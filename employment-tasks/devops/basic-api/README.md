# Site Reliability Engineer - Basic API Hosting Task

## Part 1 – The Web Service

Write a web service in any language that takes in a JSON payload, does
some basic validation against an expected message format and content,
and then puts that payload into a queue of your choice or a file.

Example valid payload:

```json
{
  "ts": "1530228282",
  "sender": "curler-user",
  "message": {
    "foo": "bar",
    "hash": "bash"
  },
  "sent-from-ip": "1.2.3.4"
}
```

Validation rules:
● “ts” must be present and a valid Unix timestamp
● “sender” must be present and a string
● “message” must be present, a JSON object, and have at least one
field set
● If present, “sent-from-ip” must be a valid IPv4 address
● All fields not listed in the example above are invalid, and
should result in the message being rejected.
