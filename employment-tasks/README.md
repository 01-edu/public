# Test tasks from the real job interviews

This folder is used to store test tasks from the real job interviews. The tasks are stored in the `test-tasks` folder. Each task is stored in a separate folder with the name of the company that provided the task. Inside the company folder, there is a `README.md` file with the task description.

The real job interviews prepare students and junior specialists for the real job interviews. The tasks are designed to test the knowledge and skills of the candidates. The tasks are usually taken from the job position interviews and the company's technology stack.
