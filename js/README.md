> You need node version 14+

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/01-edu/public.git

# go into the dom directory
cd public/js/tests
```

### Executing a test

```bash
# run a test
node test.mjs /user/you/piscine-repo exercise-name
```

The first argument `/user/you/piscine-repo` is the directory
where the test should look for your solution,
usualy your piscine repository.

The second argument `exercise-name` should match exactly
the name of an exercise, not including `.js`
