Making a review involves 2 students who are goning to review each other's exercise.
Each user has to :

-   **check** the code of the other one on Github
-   **bet** if it is going to fail or succeed in the Review interface
-   **run** his own exercise in the Review interface to give a result to compare with the bet, and state if it was right or wrong

## Usage

To submit an exercise to review and be reviewed, go to the `Review panel` on the right of the quest interface and click on the button to submit it :

Then, when a match with another student who also wants to review is found, you will be notified :

Once you and the other student have confirmed the match, you can go and check the code of the other student on his repository in the component `Your review` :

When you have checked his code, those 4 steps will have to be completed to achieve the review :

-   You have to bet if the exercise of the other student will fail or succeed after running the tester
-   The other student has to do the same with your exercise and make his own bet, that you will see on the component `Review of your exercise`

-   Once the other student's bet is set, the tester button unblocks and you have to run it on your exercise to output the result determining if your exercise has failed or succeeded ; this result is compared to the other student's bet to determine if it was wrong or right
-   The other student also has to run the tester on his exercise to determine his result and so if your bet was wrong or right

In fact, a bet is succeeded if it is equal to the tester output :

You can have those 4 cases :

| bet     | tester output | bet result    |
| ------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| fail    | failed        | **succeeded** |
| fail    | succeeded     | **failed**    |
| succeed | succeeded     | **succeeded** |
| succeed | failed        | **failed**    |
