**Linux compatible only**

| Component   | Minimum specifications  |
| ----------- | ----------------------- |
| Processor   | x86-64 (64 bits)        |
| Memory      | 8 GB                    |

| Motherboard | UEFI & PXE boot support |

## Other considerations

- The monitor must be flicker-free (no PWM) to preserve the student's attention & eye health.
- To avoid damaging the PC ports, all cables (USB, Audio) must be connected to cheaper and easier to replace extension cables.
- Energy consumption is an important criterion to be taken into account.
- It is better to buy the computers without a Windows licence, as it is an unnecessary extra cost.
