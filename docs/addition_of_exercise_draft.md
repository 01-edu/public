# THE ADDITION OF EXERCISE PROCEDURE


##### This is for a go exercise in the piscine-go

## **1. Writing the subject and / or writing the solution**
 
Always address each exceptional cases.

Example:  [fprime](https://github.com/01-edu/public/blob/master/subjects/fprime.en.md).

The exceptional cases in the `usage` part. 

```console
student@ubuntu:~/piscine-go/test$ go build
student@ubuntu:~/piscine-go/test$ ./test 225225
3*3*5*5*7*11*13
student@ubuntu:~/piscine-go/test$ ./test 8333325
3*3*5*5*7*11*13*37

...

student@ubuntu:~/piscine-go/test$ ./test 0

student@ubuntu:~/piscine-go/test$ ./test 1
1
student@ubuntu:~/piscine-go/test$
```

The subject states that only **positive integer** will be tested, however, 0 and 1 are not primes.

The subject writer made a mistake because of forgetting that fact.

During the exam, the test was testing the `1` case and expecting a `1\n` to be printed. The real result should only have been a `\n`.

Some students found this mistake. An update of the subject during the exam treating that special case was immediately necessary.

1. Try to avoid the “you” and contracted “language”

2. Always check the formating md

### fprime  <span style="color:#ff3234">(Title of the exercise)</span>

#### Instructions <span style="color:#ff3234">(Instructions of the exercise)</span>


Write a program that takes a positive `int` and displays its prime factors, followed by a newline (`'\n'`). <span style="color:#ff3234">(general guidelines, notice the imperative style tense and the avoidance of “you”. “You” is authorized in the case of a presence of a back story where the player is immersed)</span>

- Factors must be displayed in ascending order and separated by `*`.  <span style="color:#ff3234">(formating requirement) </span>

- If the number of parameters is different from 1, the program displays a newline.  <span style="color:#ff3234">(special case requirement, this case will need to be tested)</span>

- The input, when there is one, will always be valid.  <span style="color:#ff3234">(Clarification on what the tester will do, hence giving the student guidelines on the cases to be handled, the tests have to reflect this instruction as well)</span>

- In this exercise the primes factor of 1 is considered as 1.  <span style="color:#ff3234">(Handling of exceptional case: THIS Happens to be a mistake, we will see uses this example for the “UPDATING A SUBJECT/TEST PROCEDURE”)</sapn>

student@ubuntu:~/piscine-go/test$ ./test 0

student@ubuntu:~/piscine-go/test$ ./test 1
1
student@ubuntu:~/piscine-go/test$
```

------

## **2. Creating the files for tests (4 main cases)**

### always in -> *all/tests/go/*

### **Folder organization**

- Function exercise in a Quest `(strlen)`
  - 2 files:
    - strlen_test.go
    - solutions/strlen.goz

```console
go
| strlen_test.go
|
| __ solutions
|     |-strlen.go (package solutions)
| 
| __ student (the same thing as the solutions, just run "cp -aT solutions/ student/")
```

- Program exercise in a Quest `(doop)`
  - 2 files
    - doop_test.go
    - solutions/doop/main.go

```console
go
| doop_test.go
|
|
| __ solutions
|     |__doop
|          |-main.go (package main)
|
| __ student (the same thing as the solutions, just run "cp -aT solutions/ student/")
```

- Program exercise in the exam `(dooprog)`
  - 2 files
    - solutions/doopprog/main.go
    - solutions/doopprog/doopprog_test.go

```console
go
|
| __ solutions
|   | __ doopprog
|         |-main.go (package main)
|         |-doopprog_test.go
|
| __ student (the same thing as the solutions, just run "cp -aT solutions/ student/")
```

- Function exercise in the exam `(atoiprog)`
  - 3 files
    - solutions/atoi.go
    - solutions/atoiprog/main.go
    - solutions/atoiprog/atoiprog_test.go

```console
go
|
| __ solutions
|     |
|     |-atoi.go (package solutions)
|     |__atoiprog
|            |-main.go (package main)(func main(){} stays empty)
|            |-atoiprog_test.go 
|
| __ student (the same thing as the solutions, just run "cp -aT solutions/ student/")
```

------

## **3. Writing a file_test.go (test file for go)**

### <span style="color:#00bae6">**RULE 1**</span>

- Make the test as independent as possible (no self-made functions imported)

- **If** the source is not in the import section, copy and paste the function, with **lowercase** for the first letter of its name.

- Example: addprimesum_test.go 
  
![isaprime](isaprime.png)

The func isAPrime is fully copied to the file.

### <span style="color:#00bae6">**RULE 2**</span>

Every special case in the subject should be tested. Preferably first. Before the randoms tests

### <span style="color:#00bae6">**RULE 3**</span>

Whenever possible do at least 1 random test!  This is to avoid cheating by predictability of the tests. If the tests are fixed, then the student may create a forest of ifs program to bypass the tester.

### z01.functions to be used by tester

- Function exercise in a Quest (strlen)   ![z01sl](strlenz01.png)
  
```go
z01.Challenge(t, studentSol, studentStu) // if the program doesn’t have arguments

z01.Challenge(t, studentSol, studentStu, args...) //if the program has arguments
```

- Program exercise in a Quest (doop)  ![z01doop](doopz01.png)<-  Screenshots to be added.

```go
z01.ChallengeMain(t) // if the program doesn’t have arguments

z01.ChallengeMain(t, args...) // if the program has arguments
```

- Program exercise in the exam (dooprog) Screenshots to be added.

```go
z01.ChallengeMainExam(t) // if the program doesn’t have arguments

z01.ChallengeMainExam (t, args...) // if the program has arguments
```

- Function exercise in the exam (Atoiprog) Screenshots to be added.

```go
z01.Challenge(t, studentSol, studentStu) // if the program doesn’t have arguments

z01.Challenge(t, studentSol, studentStu, args...) //if the program has arguments
```

------

## **4. Testing locally (`go test` or `go test -run=Test\<nameOfTheFunction\>`)**

### you do -run=... because you have many test files, so you need to run just one

### Before every PR : a go test has to be executed (in several situations) in the folder(s) of the exercise(s) worked on

**First thing first**

```console
rm -r student
cp -aT solutions/ student
```

### Execute a go test in the appropriate folder

- Function exercise in a Quest `(strlen)` ![](image.png) 

`all/test/go`

```console
go test -run=TestStrlen
```

- Program exercise in a Quest `(doop)`  ![](image.png)<-  Screenshots to be added.

`all/test/go/`

```console
go test -run=TestDoop
```

- Program exercise in the exam `(dooprog)` Screenshots to be added.

Here you can do just *go test*, because there's only one test file

`all/test/go/student/dooprog`

```console
go test
```

- Function exercise in the exam `(atoiprog)` Screenshots to be added.

`all/test/go/student/atoiprog`

```console
go test
```


### **NOTE:** If a go test gives a (cached) result, use this type of command (example with raid3): 

```go test count=1 raid3_test.go``` 

The result should be an OK message:

- This means that the test is running correctly when the correct solution is given. If this does not work, the test file is likely to have errors inside. 

- Time should be under 5-6 seconds. If longer, remove some of the iteration of the random tests  (for example, less random tests)

- Be watchful of exercises with challenge function: Always test a copy of the variable and not the same variable for both the student and the solution function.

- Introduce errors in the student solution.go file in order to see the errors message and compare them to the subject examples.

- Error messages for structures exercises (linked lists, binary trees) need to be tailored accordingly.
