## ztail

### Instructions

Write a program called `ztail` that has the same behaviour as the system command `tail`, but which takes at least one file as argument.

-   The only option to be handled is `-c`. This option will be used in all tests.

-   For this program the "os" package can be used.

-   For the program to pass the tests the convention for the return code of program in Unix systems should be followed (see os.Exit).

-   For more information consult the man page for `tail`.
