## ztail

### Instructions

Write a program called `ztail` that has the same behaviour as the system command `tail`, but which takes at least one file as argument.

- The only option to be handled is `-c`. This option will be used in all tests.

- For this program the "os" package can be used.

- For the program to pass the tests the convention for the return code of program in Unix systems should be followed (see os.Exit).

- Handle the errors and output the same error messages as `tail`.

- For more information consult the man page for `tail`.

### Note:

This program is gonna be tested against `tail`, be sure to check all the different error messages with different permutations of the arguments.
