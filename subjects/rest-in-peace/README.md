### Instructions

The battle is won! The Army of the Dead have finally fulfilled their oath. It is
now time to free them so that they may rest in peace.

But first we need to regroup and count them to make sure not one single soul is
left behind. We will provide a four variables of type array:

- `swordMen`
- `archers`
- `captains`
- `generals`

You will need to concat the content of `swordMen` and `archers` into one array
`footSoldiers`. That batallion is lead by `'Grim the Terrible'`. He likes to
scream to soldiers that walks too slow, so you need to put him as the last
element of the array.

Then you will do the same for `captains` and `generals` into the array
`horseMen`. That batallion is lead by `'The Skull Knight'`. He, on the other
hand, likes to lead from the front. He needs to be the first element of the
array.

Finally you will do it one more time for `footSoldiers` and `horseMen` into the
array `armyOfTheDead`. For having a better overview, `'The King of the Dead'`
needs to be tactically positioned in between his foot soldiers and his knights.

Oh! and here is a little detail, the methods `concat`, `push` and `unshift` were
damaged during the battle... so find another way.

Hurry, they are waiting...
