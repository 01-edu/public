## Redeclaration of Love ğŸ’•

### Assign, re-assign

Remember the `let` keyword used to declare new variables.

Redeclaring a variable will crash !

But it is still possible to use the `=` _(assignation operator)_ to change its
value !

### Instructions

The variable `love` has been declared and will be used during the tests.

You must try to re-assign the `love` variable to the string value
`I still love you !!` but without re-declaring it !
