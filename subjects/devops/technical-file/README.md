## Technical File

### Objective

To prepare to compile a technical file, with a view to obtaining the Level 7 RNCP title of Cloud DevOps expert.

You'll write a project report for each project you validate during your training, so that you can trace your achievements. You'll use your reports to compile a **personal** technical file at the end of your study period.

### Preparing for your technical file

Each time you validate a project (whether alone or in a group), you'll need to write a report. This must be completed individually, so that is shows **your** understanding.

The focus of your technical file is to detail what you have learned, and what you have achieved during your training. This allows you to demonstrate your mastery of:

- Knowledge of Cloud Service Providers and Infrastructure
- Automation and orchestration of containerized services
- DevOps project management

You should write and store your reports inside the repository of this project. The repository will be comprised of a series of markdown files, with one for each project that you validate during your training. These should be named as `project-name.md`, so that you can trace your progress.

You will have 5 additional days beyond the end of your training to finalize your technical file.

### Contents of the reports

The reports must detail a description of the project, and justifications for your choices. You should cover:

- The problem you needed to solve
- The constraints you needed to work with
- The different stages of solving the problem:
  - Continuous integration
  - Continuous delivery
  - Quality control
- The technological choices you made
- The expected results, and anticipated problems
- The obtained results, and actual problems faced

### Compiling the technical file

You will have 5 days after the end of your training period in which to finalize your technical file.

Your technical files must be an individual piece of work, and be comprised of approximately 8-10 pages.

You will rely on the contents of your project reports in order to trace your achievements.

Particular care must be given to spelling and presentation.
