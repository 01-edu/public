#### Functional

##### Before we start, let's check we have the necessary tools to perform the tests. You should make sure VirtualBox, Vagrant and Postman are installed, if not you should install them.

#### Documentation

##### Take a look at the `README.md` file provided by the student.

###### Does the file include enough context and details to understand and run the project?

#### VM Configuration

##### In the directory of the project run `vagrant up --provider virtualbox` and then run `vagrant status`.

###### Can you confirm that the three VMs (`gateway-vm`, `inventory-vm` and `billing-vm`) are up and running?

##### Locate the `.env` file in the root of the project, run `cat .env`:

###### Does the output contain all the necessary credentials for the microservices to run properly?

###### Is the source code free from any credential that could have been added to the `.env` file?

###### Is the student able to explain the commands included in `/scripts` directory and why they are used?

#### Inventory API Endpoints

##### Open Postman and make a `POST` request to `http://[GATEWAY_IP]:[GATEWAY_PORT]/api/movies/` address with the following body as `Content-Type: application/json`:

```json
{
  "title": "A new movie",
  "description": "Very short description"
}
```

###### Can you confirm the response was the success code `201`?

##### In Postman make a `GET` request to `http://[GATEWAY_IP]:[GATEWAY_PORT]/api/movies/` address.

###### Can you confirm the response was success code `200` and the body of the response is in `json` with the information of the last added movie?

##### Ask to locate the Postman configuration file in the files committed by the student and import this file in Postman.

###### Can you confirm the imported endpoints includes all methods supported by both APIs and that all of those methods are returning the expected response? (use the subject as a reference)

#### PostgreSQL database for Inventory

##### Run `vagrant ssh inventory-vm` to enter into the VM, then run `sudo -i -u postgres`, then `psql` and once in the database enter `\l`.

###### Can you confirm the `movies` database is listed?

##### Still in `psql` run `\c movies` and then `TABLE movies;`.

###### Can you confirm the entries are presents and reflect the calls you made when checking the endpoints for this API?

#### Billing API Endpoints

##### Open Postman and make a `POST` request to `http://[GATEWAY_IP]:[GATEWAY_PORT]/api/billing/` address with the following body as `Content-Type: application/json`:

```json
{
  "user_id": "20",
  "number_of_items": "99",
  "total_amount": "250"
}
```

###### Can you confirm the response was success code `200`?

##### Run `vagrant ssh billing-vm` to interact with the proper VM. Run `sudo pm2 stop billing_app` and then `sudo pm2 list`.

###### Can you confirm the `billing_app` API was correctly stopped?

##### Open Postman and make a `POST` request to `http://[GATEWAY_IP]:[GATEWAY_PORT]/api/billing/` address with the following body as `Content-Type: application/json`:

```json
{
  "user_id": "22",
  "number_of_items": "10",
  "total_amount": "50"
}
```

###### Can you confirm the response was success code `200` even if the `billing_app` is not working?

#### PostgreSQL database for Billing

##### Run `vagrant ssh billing-vm` to enter into the VM, then run `sudo -i -u postgres`, then `psql` and once in the database enter `\l`.

###### Can you confirm the `orders` database is listed?

##### Still in `psql` run `\c orders` and then `TABLE orders;`.

###### Can you confirm the order with `user_id = 20` is listed properly?

###### Can you confirm the order with `user_id = 22` is NOT listed?

#### Check resilience of messaging queue

##### Run `sudo pm2 start billing_app` to start again the Billing API. At this point enter again in the database following the same instructions of the previous section.

###### Can you confirm the order with `user_id = 22` is now listed properly?
