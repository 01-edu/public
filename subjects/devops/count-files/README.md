## Count files

### Instructions

Create a file `count-files.sh`, which will print the number **(and only the number)** of regular files and folders contained in the current directory and its sub-folders (the current directory must be included in the count).

### Usage

```console
$ ./count-files.sh | cat -e
12$
$
```

### Hints

Here are some Commands that can help you:

- `find`. Find files or directories under the given directory tree, recursively.
- `wc`. Count lines, words, and bytes.
