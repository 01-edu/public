## More Or Less

### Instructions

Create 4 functions:

- `more` that takes 1 argument and adds 1 to it.
- `less` that takes 1 argument and subtracts 1 from it.
- `add` that takes 2 arguments and adds them together.
- `sub` that takes 2 arguments and subtracts the second argument from the first.

All the functions must return the result of the operations specified above.

Each function should be defined with the exact number of parameters needed.
