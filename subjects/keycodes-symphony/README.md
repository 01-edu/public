## Keycodes symphony

### Instructions

Like an inspired Beethoven who's going to write his Moonlight Sonata, you're about to compose a colourful symphony of letters with your keyboard.

Export the function `compose`:

- Make it fire every time a key is pressed
- Create a new `note`, which has a background color generated using its `keyCode`, and displays the corresponding letter pressed
- If the pressed key is the `Delete` one, delete the last note
- If the pressed key is the `Escape` one, clear all the notes

### Notions

- [Keyboard event](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/KeyboardEvent): [`keydown`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/keydown_event), [`key`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/KeyboardEvent/key)
