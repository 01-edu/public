## expandstr

### Instructions

Write a program that takes a `string` and displays it with exactly three spaces between each word, with no spaces or tabs at either the beginning nor the end.

The `string` will be followed by a newline (`'\n'`).

A word is a sequence of alphanumerical characters.

If the number of arguments is not 1, or if there are no word, the program displays nothing.
