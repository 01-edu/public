#### Functional

###### Is the framework implemented without using any other high-level library/framework like `React`, `Angular`, `Vue` and similar?

##### Open the documentation file.

###### Is the documentation written in a markdown file?

###### Does the documentation contain a top-level overview of the framework's features?

###### Does the documentation contain an explanation and code examples on how to create an element, add attributes to an element, create an event and nest elements?

###### Does the documentation contain an explanation on how the framework works?

##### Open the todoMVC project and compare it to other [todoMVC project](http://todomvc.com/) ([example](https://todomvc.com/examples/javascript-es6/dist/)).

###### Does it contain every element as the other todoMVCs examples?

##### Open the Web Developer Tools (Ctrl+Shift+I) and check for the classes, ids, etc.

###### Does it correctly correspond to those in the examples?

###### Can you add a to-do element to the to-do list?

###### When you add a to-do element to the list, does the footer (element with class footer) appear as in other examples?

###### Can you check/uncheck a to-do element on the list?

###### Can you remove a to-do element off the list?

##### Add at least 2 to-dos and select only one of them.

###### If you click on the **Active** button, do only the unchecked to-dos appear?

###### And if you click on the **Completed** button, do only the checked to-dos appear?

###### Does a **Clear Completed** button to-dos appear?

###### When clicking on the clear completed button, does it remove only the checked to-dos?

###### When clicking on the **Active** and **Completed** buttons, does the URL change?

##### Add 3 to-dos to the list and check each one, keeping an eye on the counter of to-dos left to do.

###### Does the counter change accordingly to your actions?

###### If you double click a to-do element on the list can you edit that element?

#### Basic

###### +Does the code obey the [good practices](../../good-practices/README.md)?

#### Bonus

###### +Is the performance similar both in the student todoMVC and other examples?

###### +Is it easier to handle the DOM using the framework than it is to use plain HTML and JS?

###### +Is it easier to handle the routing in JS using the framework?

###### +Does the project run quickly and effectively? (Favoring recursivity, no unnecessary data requests, etc...)

###### +Is the code using asynchronicity to increase performance?

###### +Do you think this project is well done in general?

#### Social

###### +Did you learn anything from this project?

###### +Would you recommend/nominate this program as an example for the rest of the school?
