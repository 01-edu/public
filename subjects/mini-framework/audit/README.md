#### Functional

###### Are all the framework API correctly documented? (If so, you will need it for the next questions)

##### First take a look at the behavior of the code presented in the [_dom/README.md_](https://public.01-edu.org/subjects/mini-framework/dom) file. Then try to replicate the behavior of the example with the corresponding template of the framework and run the app.

###### Can you create the red box and the button present in the example?

##### With the same example as above, open the Web Developer Tools (Ctrl+Shift+I) and go to the Inspector Tab.

###### Are the elements created as they should (the red box and the button inside the app div)?

##### Still on the Inspector Tab, does all the elements have the right attributes (id, class, style)?

###### With the same example, did the box move when you clicked the button?

##### First take a look at the behavior of the code presented in the [_routing/README.md_](https://public.01-edu.org/subjects/mini-framework/routing) file. Then try to replicate the behavior of the example with the corresponding template of the framework and run the app. (Making the page reload is not required)

###### Were you able to switch between the two pages?

###### With the same example as above, did the URL changed when you switch between pages?

##### With the same example, try to define a state by assigning a value to it in the 'Home Page' and then switch to the 'Active Page'.

###### If you check the state, does it kept the value assigned to it?

#### Bonus

###### +Is the performance similar both in the framework code and the examples above?

###### +Is it easier to handle the DOM using the framework than it is to use plain HTML and JS?

###### +Is it easier to handle the routing in JS using the framework?

###### +Does the project runs quickly and effectively? (Favoring recursive, no unnecessary data requests, etc)

###### +Is the code using synchronicity to increase performance?
