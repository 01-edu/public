#### Functional

###### Are all the framework API correctly documented?

##### Open the todoMVC project and compare it to other [todoMVC project](http://todomvc.com/) ([example](http://todomvc.com/examples/vanillajs/)).

###### Does it contain every element as the other todoMVCs examples?

##### Open the Web Developer Tools (Ctrl+Shift+I) and check for the classes, ids, etc.

###### Does it correctly correspond to those in the examples?

###### Can you add a todo element to the todo list?

###### When you add a todo element to the list, does the footer (element with class footer) appear as in other examples?

###### Can you check/uncheck a todo element on the list?

###### Can you remove a todo element off the list?

##### Add at least 2 todos and select only one of them.

###### If you click on the **Active** button, does it appear only the unchecked todos?

###### And if you click on the **Completed** button, does it appear only the checked todos?

###### Does it appear a **Clear Completed** button todos?

###### When clicking on the clear completed button, does it remove only the checked todos?

###### When clicking on the **Active** and **Completed** buttons, does the URL change?

##### Add 3 todos to the list and check each one, keeping an eye on the counter of todos left to do.

###### Does the counter change accordingly to your actions?

###### If you double click a todo element on the list can you edit that element?

#### Bonus

###### +Is the performance similar both in the student todoMVC and other examples?

###### +Is it easier to handle the DOM using the framework than it is to use plain HTML and JS?

###### +Is it easier to handle the routing in JS using the framework?

###### +Does the project runs quickly and effectively? (Favoring recursive, no unnecessary data requests, etc)

###### +Is the code using synchronicity to increase performance?
