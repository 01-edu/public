## range

### Instructions

Write the function Range which must:

- allocate (with make()) an array of integers.
- fill it with consecutive values that begin at `start` and end at `end` (Including `start` and `end` !)
- finally return that array.

### Expected function

```go
func Range(start, end int) []int {

}
```

Examples of outputs :

- With (1, 3) you will return an array containing 1, 2 and 3.
- With (-1, 2) you will return an array containing -1, 0, 1 and 2.
- With (0, 0) you will return an array containing 0.
- With (0, -3) you will return an array containing 0, -1, -2 and -3.
