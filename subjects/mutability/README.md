## Mutability

### Instructions

Create three copies of the `person` object named `clone1`, `clone2` and `samePerson`.

Increase the `age` of `person` by one, and set its `country` to `'FR'`.

You must find a way to keep the original values of `clone1` and `clone2`. The values of `samePerson` should change when `person` is changed.
