## Mutability

### Instructions

Create three copies of the person object called `clone1`, `clone2` and `samePerson`.

Increase by one the property age of `person` and set his country to `'FR'`.

A way must be found to have `clone1` and `clone2` keep the original values while `samePerson` changes with `person`.
