## Chaikin

### Instructions

Implement the [Chaikin's](http://graphics.cs.ucdavis.edu/education/CAGDNotes/Chaikins-Algorithm/Chaikins-Algorithm.html) algorithm step by step in an animation.

The objective is to create a canvas where the user will draw 1 or more and then the screen will play an animation of each step to get to the final result of a curve drawn using the `Chaikin's` algorithm. You can see [here](https://youtu.be/PbB2eKnA2QI) a demo of how the application should work.

- Functionality:

  - The canvas should receive input from the mouse: the user of the program should be able to use the left button to select the control point for the `Chaikin's` algorithm

  - After pressing `Return` should start the animation of the steps until reaching the 7th step of the `Chaikin's` algorithm.

  - Pressing `Escape` should quit the window.

### Note

You are free to use any library for creating and handling window creation, rendering, keyboard and mouse events.

### Bonus

- Add the ability to clear the screen and add new control points.

- Make possible to drag the control points in real time.
