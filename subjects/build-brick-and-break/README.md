## Build brick and break

### Instructions

Today, your mission is to build a 3-column brick tower, maintain it and finally break it!

Create a function `build` which will create and display the given amount of bricks passed as argument:

- each brick has to be created and added to the page at a regular interval of time (at least 50ms),
- each brick will receive a unique `id` property, like following:

```html
<div id="brick-1"></div>
```

- each brick in the middle column has to be set with the custom attribute `foundation` receiving the value `true`

Each one of the two emojis in the top-right corner fires a function on click:

- ðŸ”¨ triggers the function `repair`
- ðŸ§¨ triggers the function `destroy`

Write the body of the `repair` function, which receives any number of `ids`, and for each `id`, retrieves the HTML element and set a custom attribute `repaired` set to `in progress` if it is a brick situated in the middle column, and `true` if not.

Write the body of the `destroy` function, which removes the current last brick in the tower.
