user:~$
```

- `inventory-db container` is a SQL database server that contains your inventory database, it must be accessible via port `5432`.
- `billing-db container` is a SQL database server that contains your billing database, it must be accessible via port `5432`.
- `inventory-app container` is a Node.js server that contains your inventory-app. It will be connected to the inventory database and accessible via port `8080`.
- `billing-app container` is a Node.js server that contains your billing-app. It will be connected to the billing database and consuming the messages from the RabbitMQ queue. It will be accessible via port `8080`.
- `rabbit-queue` is a RabbitMQ server that contains the queue.
- `api-gateway-app container` is a Node.js server that contains your api-gateway-app. It will forward the requests to the other services and it's accessible via port `3000`.

##### Check the Container restart policy:

```console
user:~$ docker inspect -f "{{ .HostConfig.RestartPolicy }}" <container-name>
{on-failure 0}
user:~$
```

###### Do all containers have the correct configuration?

###### Are the containers configured to restart in case of failure?

#### Check the Docker volumes:

```console
user:~$ docker volume ls
DRIVER    VOLUME NAME
<...>     inventory-database
<...>     billing-database
<...>     api-gateway-app
user:~$
```

- `inventory-database volume` contains the inventory database.
- `billing-database volume` contains the billing database.
- `api-gateway-app volume` contains the API gateway logs.

###### Do all volumes have the correct configuration?

#### Inventory API Endpoints

##### Open Postman and make a `POST` request to `http://[GATEWAY_IP]:[GATEWAY_PORT]/api/movies/` address with the following body as `Content-Type: application/json`:

```json
{
  "title": "A new movie",
  "description": "Very short description"
}
```

###### Can you confirm the response was the success code `200`?

##### In Postman make a `GET` request to `http://[GATEWAY_IP]:[GATEWAY_PORT]/api/movies/` address.

###### Can you confirm the response was success code `200` and the body of the response is in `json` with the information of the last added movie?

#### Billing API Endpoints

##### Open Postman and make a `POST` request to `http://[GATEWAY_IP]:[GATEWAY_PORT]/api/billing/` address with the following body as `Content-Type: application/json`:
