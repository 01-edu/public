## Sign

### Instructions

Create the `sign` function that takes one number argument
and return 1 if the number is positive, -1 if the number is negative
and 0 if the number is exactly 0
You must not just use `Math.sign`, make your own.

Create the `sameSign` function that takes 2 numbers as arguments and return true
if they both have the same sign, or false otherwise.
