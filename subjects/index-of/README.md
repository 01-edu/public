## Index Of

### Instructions

Create 3 functions:

- `indexOf` which returns the index of the first occurence of a value and takes as arguments an array to be searched, the value to be matched, and optionally the index from where to start searching from.
- `lastIndexOf` which works just like the previous function but returns the index of the last occurence of a value
- `includes` which returns true if the value was found in the array

> If a value is not found, the returned index is -1

> functions should have an array element as first argument,
> both `indexOf` and `lastIndexOf` take an additional `fromIndex` argument
> that allows you to begin searching from a specific index.
