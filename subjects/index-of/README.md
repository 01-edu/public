## Index Of

### Instructions

Create 3 functions which accept an array to be searched, and a value to be matched.

- `indexOf`: which returns the index of the first occurrence. It also accepts an **optional** index from where the search should begin. If the value was not found, `-1` is returned.
- `lastIndexOf`: which works just like your `indexOf` function, but returns the index of the last occurrence.
- `includes`: which returns `true` if the value was found in the array, and `false` otherwise.

> Of course you **must not** use any of `Array.indexOf()`, `Array.lastIndexOf()` or `Array.includes()`.
