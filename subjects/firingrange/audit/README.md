###### Are the map size and composition (using cubes) being respected?

###### Are the projectile size and speed being respected?

###### If you try to move the target to the target zone, is the player forbidden from trespassing to that zone by a invisible wall?

###### When you shoot a target, does the bullet go through the invisible wall?

###### Did the targets lay on the ground correctly on the floor when hit by the projectile?

###### Did the target rotate from the bottom and not from the center?

###### Is there only one class “BP_Target” is present on the project?

###### Do all the public variable have a tooltip? (Mouse over it to check if a description is set or check if the variable have a little green eye on the right)
