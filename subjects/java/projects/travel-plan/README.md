## Travel-Plan

### Objectives

The primary goal of this project is to construct a robust and scalable environment for the Travel Management System and to develop a comprehensive Admin Dashboard that serves as the control center for travel management operations.

### Instructions

#### 1. Environment Configuration

In the initial phase of the Travel Management System, students will configure a microservices architecture following industry best practices to ensure scalability and high availability. This includes implementing multiple replicas of each microservice to support load balancing and failover mechanisms, essential for achieving system resilience and service continuity. The task encompasses the installation and configuration of PostgreSQL and Neo4j databasesâ€”both containerized for scalability and replication ease. A Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) pipeline, employing Jenkins and SonarQube, will automate code quality checks and testing. Docker, in synergy with Ansible, will facilitate the automated provisioning and deployment of the microservices and allied components. Ansible playbooks must be crafted to deploy every system element, ensuring consistency and scalability. The successful configuration will yield an automated, scalable infrastructure, setting the stage for the Admin Dashboard development and further Travel Management System features.

#### 2. Development and Design

- Craft an Admin Dashboard enabling administrators to oversee users, travels, and payment gateways.
- Ensure each travel entry includes a destination or trajectory, dates, duration, activities or itinerary, accommodation, and transportation details.
- Develop an authentication and authorization service to safeguard access and operations.
- Design a responsive and intuitive UI for the Admin Dashboard, ensuring cross-device and browser compatibility.
- Utilize any beneficial packages to enhance development efficiency, with the expectation to justify package selections during project reviews.

#### 3. Best Practices & Ecosystem Familiarity

- Adopt a collaborative development workflow using pull requests (PRs) for introducing changes and features.
- Perform thorough code reviews on each PR to maintain code integrity, security adherence, and best practice compliance.
- Integrate a CI/CD pipeline via Jenkins for seamless build, test, and deployment workflows of PRs.
- Ensure all PRs undergo a rigorous review process, securing approval before merging into the main codebase.

#### 4. Security Measures

- Implement SSL/TLS encryption for all data in transit.
- Ensure databases and services are accessible only within the internal network or via secure, authenticated endpoints.
- Use secret management tools like HashiCorp Vault to handle sensitive information like API keys and database credentials.
- Apply the principle of least privilege across all levels of the system, particularly in role-based access controls within the Admin Dashboard.
- Regularly update all components to patch known vulnerabilities and ensure compliance with security best practices.

### Bonus

- Compose clear and detailed documentation for the application and database schema.
- Incorporate Kubernetes alongside Ansible to enhance service management, orchestration, and load balancing capabilities.
- any other bonus that add a real value to the project.
