#### Functional

##### Setup and Installation

###### Has the Angular application been set up correctly with the necessary dependencies?

##### Component Creation

###### Are there separate components for each distinct part of the application, i.e., `HomeComponent`, `CaptchaComponent`, and `ResultComponent`?

##### Captcha Challenges

###### Does the Captcha component present the user with multiple challenges?

###### Are these challenges varied and require different types of user interaction (e.g., selecting images, solving math problems, entering text)?

##### Form Validation

###### Is form validation implemented correctly for each challenge?

###### Can the user not proceed to the next challenge without completing the current one?

##### State Management

###### Is state management used correctly to track the user's progress across challenges?

###### Does the application maintain the state even if the page is refreshed?

##### Results Page

###### Does the application redirect the user to a results page upon completion of all challenges?

###### Does the results page provide feedback to the user, congratulating them on proving they are not a bot?

#### Bonus

##### Multiple Challenge Sets

###### Are there multiple sets of challenges that are randomly assigned to each user session?

##### Transitions and Responsiveness

###### Are there smooth animations between challenges?

###### Is the application responsive across different devices and screen sizes?

##### Testing (optional)

###### Are there unit tests for the components?

###### Do the tests cover all the important aspects of the components?

Remember to use this audit as a guideline to assess the student's work. The student doesn't have to implement all the bonus tasks to pass the project. The main focus should be on understanding and correctly using Angular concepts to build the application.
