#### Functional

##### Open two browsers (ex: Chrome and Firefox or private windows) and log in with different users in each one. With one user start typing.

###### Is there any animation confirming that the typing in progress is working?

##### Using the same two browsers, start typing with one of the users.

###### Does the animation work smoothly, without movement interruptions?

##### Using the same two browsers, start typing with one of the users.

###### Is the animation from the typing in progress engine user friendly (easy to understand/see)?

##### Using the same two browsers, start typing with one of the users.

###### Can you confirm that the typing in progress has the name of the user that is typing?

##### Open two browsers (ex: Chrome and Firefox or private windows) and log in with different users in each one. With one user start typing and then stop.

###### Can you confirm that the typing in progress engine stopped when the user stop typing?

##### Open two browsers (ex: Chrome and Firefox or private windows) and log in with different users in each one, then start a conversation between the users.

###### Is typing in progress engine working properly in both users? (each one can see when the other is typing or not)

#### Bonus

###### +Does the project runs quickly and effectively? (Favoring recursive, no unnecessary data requests, etc)

###### +Does the code obey the [good practices](https://public.01-edu.org/subjects/good-practices/README.md)?

###### +Is the code using synchronicity (Promises and goroutines/channels) to increase performance?

###### +Do you think in general this project is well done?
