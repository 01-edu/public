##### Open two browsers (ex: Chrome and Firefox or private windows) and log in with different users in each one. With one user start typing.

###### Is there any animation confirming that the typing in progress is working?

##### Using the same two browsers, start typing with one of the users.

###### Does the animation work smoothly, without movement interruptions?

##### Using the same two browsers, start typing with one of the users.

###### Is the animation from the typing in progress engine user friendly (easy to understand/see)?

##### Using the same two browsers, start typing with one of the users.

###### Can you confirm that the typing in progress has the name of the user that is typing?

##### Open two browsers (ex: Chrome and Firefox or private windows) and log in with different users in each one. With one user starting to type and then stopping.
