## Is Winner

### Instructions

Create a function `isWinner` that, by making use of `winners` "API", should
return a resolved Promise with the string:

- `<country> + ' never was a winner'`, if the country passed
in `isWinner` has never won a the FIFA World Cup

- `<country> + ' is not what we are looking for because of the continent'`,
  if the country passed in `isWinner` is not from the european
continent

- `<country> + ' is not what we are looking for because of the number of
times it was champion'`, if the country passed in `isWinner` was champion
less than 3 times

- `<country> + ' won the FIFA World Cup in ' + <year(s)> + 'winning by '
+ <results>`, otherwise.

If the country was champion in more than one year, the years should be
displayed like : '1000, 1004, 1008'. The same goes for the results
