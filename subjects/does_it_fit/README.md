## does_it_fit

### Instructions

Use the `areas_volumes` module provided below to create the two following **functions**:

Create `area_fit`. It should return whether the geometric shape can fit inside the rectangular area as many times as indicated by `times`.

The arguments of the function will be:

- `x` and `y`: length and width of the rectangular area.
- `kind`: the kind of geometric shape.
- `times`: the number of times the shape should fit inside the rectangular area.
- `a`: represents the:
  - `side` in case of a `Square`
  - `base` in case of a `Triangle`
  - `radius` in case of a `Circle`
  - `side_a` in case of a `Rectangle`
- `b`: represents the:
  - `height` in case of a `Triangle`
  - `side_b` in case of a `Rectangle`

Create `volume_fit`. It should return whether the geometric volume can fit inside the box as many times as indicated by `times`.

The arguments of the function will be:

- `x`, `y` and `z`: length, width and depth of the box.
- `kind`: the kind of geometric volume.
- `times`: the number of times the shape should fit inside the box.
- `a`: represents the:
  - `side` in case of a `Cube`
  - `radius` in case of a `Sphere`
  - `base_area` in case of a `TriangularPyramid`
  - `side_a` in case of a `Parallelepiped`
  - `base_radius` in case of a `Cone`
- `b`: represents the:
  - `height` in case of a `TriangularPyramid`
  - `side_b` in case of a `Parallelepiped`
  - `height` in case of a `Cone`
- `c`: represents the:
  - `side_c` in case of a `Parallelepiped`

### Expected Functions

```rust
pub fn area_fit(
    (x, y): (usize, usize),
    kind: areas_volumes::GeometricalShapes,
    times: usize,
    (a, b): (usize, usize),
) -> bool {
    todo!()

pub(crate) fn square_area(side: usize) -> usize {
    side.pow(2)

}

pub(crate) fn triangular_pyramid_volume(base_area: f64, height: usize) -> f64 {
    (base_area * height as f64) / 3.0
}

pub(crate) fn parallelepiped_volume(side_a: usize, side_b: usize, side_c: usize) -> usize {
    side_a * side_b * side_c

pub(crate) fn cone_volume(base_radius: usize, height: usize) -> f64 {
    (1.0 / 3.0) * std::f64::consts::PI * base_radius.pow(2) as f64 * height as f64
}
```

### Usage

Here is a program to test your function:

```rust
use does_it_fit::*;

fn main() {
    println!(
        "Do 100 rectangles (2x1) fit in a 2 by 4 square? {}",
        area_fit((2, 4), GeometricalShapes::Rectangle, 100, (2, 1))
    );
    println!(
        "Do 3 triangles (5 base and 3 height) fit in a 5 by 5 square? {}",
        area_fit((5, 5), GeometricalShapes::Triangle, 3, (5, 3))
    );
    println!(
        "Do 3 spheres (2 radius) fit in a 5 by 5 by 5 box? {}",
        volume_fit((5, 5, 5), GeometricalVolumes::Sphere, 3, (2, 0, 0))
    );
    println!(
        "Does 1 parallelepiped (6 base, 7 height and depth 4) fit in a 5 by 7 by 5 parallelepiped? {}",
        volume_fit((5, 7, 5), GeometricalVolumes::Parallelepiped, 1, (6, 7, 4))
    );
}
```

And its output:

```sh
$ cargo run
Do 100 rectangles (2x1) fit in a 2 by 4 square? false
Do 3 triangles (5 base and 3 height) fit in a 5 by 5 square? true
Do 3 spheres (2 radius) fit in a 5 by 5 by 5 box? true
Does 1 parallelepiped (6 base, 7 height and depth 4) fit in a 5 by 7 by 5 parallelepiped? true
$
```
