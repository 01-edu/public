## print_and_consume

### Instructions

Create a function `print_and_consume` which takes a `String`, print the string with a new line at the end and consume it (the string can't be used after the function is called).

Create a function `only_print` that takes a `String` and print it with a new line without consuming it.

### Expected functions

```rust
pub fn print_and_consume(argument) {
}

pub fn only_print(argument) {
}

```

### Usage

Here is a possible program to test your function :

```rust
use print_and_consume::*;

fn main() {}
```

And its output:

```console
$ cargo run

$
```
