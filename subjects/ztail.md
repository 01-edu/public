## ztail

### Instructions

Write a program called ztail that does the same thing as the system command tail, but witch takes at least one file as argument.

The only option you have to handle is -c. This option will be used in all tests.

For this program you can use the "os" package.

For the program to pass the test you should follow the convention for the return code of program in Unix sistems (see os.Exit)

For more information consult the man page for tail.
