## verydisco

### Instructions

Create a `verydisco.mjs` script that :

- takes the 1st argument from the command line (after the program name)
- makes it very disco:
  - cut each word from this argument in 2 (rounded up),
  - re-compose a word by concatenating the chunks in the other order
- display the result in console

If the argument passed is a sentence, each word of the sentence must be "very disco".

For example:

- `discovery` would print `verydisco` (üï∫üèº) in console.
- `Node is awesome` would print `deNo si omeawes` in the console.
