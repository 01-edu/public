## Keep

### Instructions

Using the `.slice` method again and the provided `alphabet` variable of a string
of all the characters in an alphabet:

- Declare a `keepFirst` variable of only the 6 first characters from `alphabet`.
- Declare a `keepLast` variable of only the 7 last characters from `alphabet`.
- Declare a `keepFirstLast` variable of the 3 first characters and 4 last
  characters from `alphabet`.

> **Example:** if `alphabet` value is `'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'`
>
> - `keepFirst` must be `'abcdef'`
> - `keepLast` must be `'tuvwxyz'`
> - `keepFirstLast` must be `'abcwxyz'`
