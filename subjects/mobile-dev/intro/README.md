## intro

Dart is an object-oriented, class-based, garbage-collected language. Dart is primarily used for client development, like web and mobile apps. It can also be used to build server and desktop applications.

Dart is the programming language of the [Flutter](https://flutter.dev) framework. Flutter is used to develop cross-platform applications for Android, iOS, web and desktop from a single codebase.

### Instructions

Let's start with the standard tradition for learning a new programming language; your first `"Hello, world!"` with dart.

Create a `main` function which prints `"Hello, world!"`, followed by a new-line character.

```dart
void main() {
	print("");
}
```

### Usage

To run the program, execute a command:

```console
$ dart intro.dart
Hello, world!
```
