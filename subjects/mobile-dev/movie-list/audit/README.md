#### Functional

> In order to run and hot reload the app either on emulator or device, follow the [instructions](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/test-drive?tab=androidstudio#run-the-app)

###### Does the app run without crashing?

###### Does the app home page contains movie icons?

###### Does every movie icon contain `name`, `image`, `genre`?

###### Can you confirm that the app is displaying the top-rated movies with descending rating on the home page?

###### Can you confirm that by tapping on a movie, a new route with more detailed information regarding the tapped movie is displayed?

###### Does the `movie page` display at least 5 parameters regarding the tapped movie?

###### Does the `appbar` have the name of the movie and a back button?

###### Is there a search-bar?

###### Does the search bar only look for movies, by `movie name`, just like SQL's **_ilike_** comparison?

###### Widgets should not be overflowed. Is it the case in both routes?

#### Bonus

###### +Does the program use a database to store movie data instead of a JSON file for better performance and scalability?

###### +Are there any `navigation transitions` implemented when switching routes?

###### +Is there any `back navigation` implemented?

###### +Is there any animated `overscroll behavior`?
