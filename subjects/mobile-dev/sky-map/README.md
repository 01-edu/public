# Sky map

### Exercise

Develop an app intended to work with GPS, accelerometer, magnetometer and real-time update. Updating an image at least 10 times in a second is considered to be real-time update.
You will be using the hardware's sensor information to determine your location, and position of the device.

With the data from the sensors, you will send the data to the public [API](https://google.com), rerieve information about celestial objects, and display them on the black canvas.

By tapping on the object, you must display a short descripton of the object.
Make sure to manage states via any of the following patterns:

- BLoC
- Provider

Objects to be diplayed:

- All planets of our solar system
- Sun and Moon
- 3 constellations of your choice

### Objectives

- Working with hardware sensors
- Collecting all the celestial object in OOP style
- Rendering objects in real-time
- Work with APIs
- Provider - [documentation](https://pub.dev/packages/provider)

Possible examples of the app:
