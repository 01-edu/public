## Variables

### Instructions

You can declare variables in two ways. The type can be implicitly detected using the `var` keyword, or explicitly by declaring the variable's type:

```dart
var strPatrick = 'Patrick';
```

```dart
String strSpongebob = 'Spongebob';
```

Declare and initialize the following variables:
- `obj` of type `Object`, containing any value.
- `planet` of type `String`, containing the name of the planet you live on.
- `year` of type `int`, containing the current year.
- `lucky` of type `bool`, containing `true` or `false` (you decide).
- constant `pi` of type `double`, containing pi value with 2 decimal places
