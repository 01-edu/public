## Variables

### Instructions

Declare and initialize following variables:

- `obj` of type `Object` containing any value;
- `planet` of type `String` containing planet's name you live on;
- `year` of type `int` containing current year;
- `lucky` of type `bool` containing true of false (you decide);
- `pi` which is a constant of type `double` containing the value of pi with 2 decimal points;

### Hints

There are two ways to declare variables in Dart:

```dart
var strPatrick = 'Patrick';
```

```dart
String strSpongebob = 'Spongebob';
```

- The first way declares using `var` which detects variable types automatically.
- The second way explicitly declares the variable's type using the appropriate keyword, such as `String` for strings, as shown in the example.
