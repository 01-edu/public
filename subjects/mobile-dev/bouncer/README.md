# Bouncer

### Introduction

Some apps require using phone's hardware. In this app you are presented such an opportunity.

Develop an app that uses [accelerometer](https://www.credencys.com/blog/accelerometer/#:~:text=What%20does%20an%20accelerometer%20in,the%20orientation%20of%20your%20app.). The app should be a smaller version of the 90s game of bouncing ball, where ball would be moving around, and playerâ€™s objective is to prevent it from touching the bottom part of the screen.

### Rules of the game

- Ball moves in a linear manner
- Ball changes its direction when it hits wall or tiles. The direction change happens by the [rule](https://www.toppr.com/ask/en-af/question/1865186/): the degree it came with should be degree it goes out, similar to real life experience.
- All tiles except player's tile disappear when they are hit with a ball
- Game ends when ball touches bottom part of the phone or all the tiles are disappeared.
- Player's tile moves according to phone's tiltiness. If phone is tilted more towards right side, so does the tile, the same with left side.

### Objective

- Working with phone hardware.
