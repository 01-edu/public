### Introduction:

The mobile app we are creating is designed to allow users to connect with their friends and track their last known location. Upon logging into the app via email, users will be able to search for their friends by email and send friend requests. Once two users have become friends within the app, they will be able to see each other's last known location when the app was turned on.

The app will use location tracking technology to determine the last known location of each user. This technology will be able to determine the user's location within a certain degree of accuracy, depending on the capabilities of the device being used.

Overall, the app is designed to be a fun and interactive way for users to stay connected with their friends and see where they've been. Whether you're meeting up for a night out on the town or just keeping tabs on your friends' whereabouts, this app is sure to be a hit with anyone who loves mobile technology.

This app is fullstack, therefore you will have to implement both backend and frontend for the project. For the frontend part, make sure to add following functionality:

    - Users authenticate via email
    - Ability to search friends via email
    - Sending 'friends' request
    - Denying/accepting 'friends' request
    - Deleting from 'friends' list
    - Seeing your friends last location

To keep users' location up to date, each time the app is open, current location must be sent to the server every 5 seconds.

To see more details on the backend part of the project, please look at the provided swagger.
