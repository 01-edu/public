# Kahoot

### Exercise

Welcome to the world of quiz-filled adventures! In this exercise, you will have the opportunity to build a dynamic mobile app using Flutter and a ready backend with Swagger. With your app, players will be able to compete against each other in a variety of themed quizzes, track their progress, and climb to the top of the leaderboard.

Get ready to test your knowledge and challenge your friends in this exciting new app. With the power of Flutter and a robust backend, the possibilities are endless. Are you up for the challenge? Let's get started!

In this exercise, you will build a mobile quiz game similar to [Kahoot](https://kahoot.it), implementing a backend that has been described by given Swagger. You will be provided with the API documentation for the backend, which includes all of the endpoints and request/response payloads that you will need to use in order to create the mobile app.

Your task will be to build a mobile app that allows users to:

- Browse a list of available quizzes
- Select and play a quiz
- Answer quiz questions
- View their score and ranking after completing the quiz

To complete this exercise, you will need to:

- Familiarize yourself with the provided Swagger
- Use the backend to retrieve the list of available quizzes and the questions for each quiz
- Display the quizzes and questions in the mobile app
- Allow users to select and play a quiz
- Track and display the user's score and ranking after they complete the quiz

This exercise will help you develop skills in building mobile apps that consume APIs, as well as testing and debugging your code. It will also help you become familiar with Swagger and the process of working with a ready backend.
