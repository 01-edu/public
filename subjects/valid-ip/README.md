## Valid Ip

### Instructions

Create a function named `findIP`, that returns an array of valid IP addresses from a given string. These addresses may or may not have a port.

For the IP part, the syntax will be as follows, where `x` is a number from 0-255. Values with leading zeros are not valid:
```
x.x.x.x
```

> Don't forget to research the syntax of IP ports.
  For this task, you **only** need to concern yourself with `<host>` and `<port>`. Don't worry about `<scheme>` or anything else.
