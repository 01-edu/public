## Count files

### Instructions

Create a file `count-files.sh`, which will print the number **(and only the number)** of regular files and folders contained in the current directory and its sub-folders (the current directory must be included in the count):

### Usage

```console
$ ./count-files.sh | cat -e
12$
$
```

**Tips:**

Here are some Commands that can help you:

- `find`. Find files or directories under the given directory tree, recursively. [For more information](https://manned.org/find).
- `wc`. Count lines, words, and bytes. [For more information](https://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/wc).

Use the man to get more info on the commands `find` and `wc`.
