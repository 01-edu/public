## Sunny Sunday

### Instructions

Let's eliminate Sundays by taking them out of the calendar, making a week only six days long, from `"Monday"` to `"Saturday"`.

Create a function called `sunnySunday` that takes a `Date` as an argument and returns the weekday as a `string`.

> 01/01/0001 is a Monday.
