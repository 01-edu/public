## Bloody Sunday

### Instructions
Let's get rid of Sundays, by removing them from the calendar. So now a week is only 6 days in length, from `"Monday"` to `"Saturday"`.

Create a function named `bloodySunday` which accepts a `Date`, and returns teh weekday as a `string`.

> 01/01/0001 is a Monday.
