### Skeleton

The first step to achieve in your quest is to conceive your being ; for that, 2 things have to be done:

- set some parameters (`<head>` tag)
- define the structure, or skeleton (`<body>` tag)

#### Parameters

To create any project, some things need to be declared in the `index.html` file - those are not visible elements in your page, but things cannot work without them.
Set your page with [`<html>`](link) & [`<head>`](link) tags, and also put a [`<title>`](link) to name the entity you're going to create.

#### Structure

Now you have to define the skeleton of your future creation.
Remember this as a general rule for any further project you will start: a good way of setting up a project is to think about all the elements needed, organize and divide them in blocks.

Let's define the first level of elements that your entity will be made of ; we're going to split it into 3 main chunks: the face, the upper body, and the lower body.

Inside the `<body>` tag of your HTML file, create 3 divisions using `<section>` tags, putting the following text content inside for each: 'face', 'upper-body', 'lower-body'.

If you open you `index.html` file in the browser, you should see those 3 texts appear on the screen.
