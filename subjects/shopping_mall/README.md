## shopping_mall

### Instructions

Using the `mall` module provided, create the following **functions** to help run a shopping mall:

- `biggest_store`: receives a `Mall` and returns the `Store` with the most `square_meters`.
- `highest_paid_employee`: receives a `Mall` and returns a vector containing the `Employee`(s) with the highest salary.
- `nbr_of_employees`: receives a `Mall` and returns the number of employees and guards as a `usize`.
- `check_for_securities`: receives a `Mall` and a map of `Guard`s keyed by their names as a `String`. If there is not at least 1 guard for every 200 square meters of total floor size, a guard should be added to the `Mall.guards`.
- `cut_or_raise`: receives a `Mall`. For each employee, the salary will be raised by 10% if they work for 10 hours or more, else their salary will be decreased by 10%. You can consider that guards are not employees of the mall.

### Expected Function

> You'll need to work out the function signatures for yourself.
