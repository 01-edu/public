## Access

Now that we know how to define objects, let's start to use them

### The dot opperator `.` (property accessor)

Let's start with getting values from them. Well, turns out you already have been
doing it a lot, remember `console.log` ?

### Instructions

We will provide a `human` variable of type object just like the one you did in
the previous exercise

Your job will be to decompose each property in its own variable:

- define a `name` variable with the value of the `name` property of the `human`
  variable
- same for `age`
- and same for `secureLuggage`
