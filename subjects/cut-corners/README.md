## Cut Corners

### Instructions

Create some functions which behave like JavaScript's `Math` rounding functions:

- `round`: which behaves similar to `Math.round()`.
- `ceil`: which behaves similar to `Math.ceil()`.
- `floor`: which behaves similar to `Math.floor()`.
- `trunc`: which behaves similar to `Math.trunc()`.

> Some restrictions apply:
> - You may not use strings conversion to do it
> - No bitwise operator
> - No `%` operator
