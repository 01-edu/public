## Unbreakable

### Instructions

Implement 2 functions:

- `split` that works like `String.split`, but takes the `string` as its first argument.

- `join` that works like `Array.join`, but take the array as
  its first argument.

### Notions

- [Array.join](https://devdocs.io/javascript/global_objects/array/join)
- [String.split](https://devdocs.io/javascript/global_objects/string/split)
