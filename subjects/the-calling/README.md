### The calling

Congrats! You created the very first base for your being and you witnessed its appearance on the digital world - your browser. But so far, it's a tiny seed of the marvelous thing it could become ; be patient, there still is a bit of work.
First of all, instead of writing down what things are - you're not writing down on your hand the word 'hand', are you?) - we're going to identify them semantically with the very practical [`id`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/id) attribute. This `id` has to be a unique identifier in your webpage, which will allow you to target your element if needed.
Your can compare it to your name & surname ; this is what is identifying you to other people, and if someone's calling you by your name, you answer.

So let's identify the 3 elements we have so far: in each section, remove the text content from inside the tag and set it as the value of the `id` attribute of the corresponding `section` tag.

Open the page in the browser: you don't see anything? Don't freak out! Inspect the HTML that have been created with your [browser inspector tool](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/What_are_browser_developer_tools), & if you worked well, you should see inside the `body` the 3 sections with the `id` attribute set in your HTML structure.
