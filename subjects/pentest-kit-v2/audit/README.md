#### General

##### Check the Repo content.

Files that must be inside the repository:

- `README.md` file with comprehensive documentation.

- `pentestkit.py` containing the source code for at least one working tool (TinyScanner or DirFinder, or both).

- `requirements.txt` listing any external dependencies used.

- At least one sample output file in an `examples/` directory.

###### Are all the required files present and properly structured?

##### Play the role of a stakeholder

Organize a simulated scenario where the student take on the role of Cyber Security Experts and explain their solution and knowledge to a team or stakeholder. Evaluate their grasp of the concepts and technologies used in the project, their communication efficacy, and their critical thinking about their solution and knowledge behind this project.

Suggested role play questions include:

- What is penetration testing and why is it important in cybersecurity?
- How do basic penetration testing tools contribute to identifying vulnerabilities?
- What challenges did you face while developing the PentestKit tool(s) and how did you address them?
- How does your toolkit help in conducting basic security assessments?
- How can your chosen tool(s) be used in a real-life security testing scenario?
- How do you ensure the ethical and legal use of these pentesting tools?
- What are the limitations of your basic toolkit compared to professional tools?
- How does your tool handle network errors and connection failures?
- **For Single Tool Implementation:** Why did you choose to focus on this specific tool and how did you ensure comprehensive functionality?
- **For Dual Tool Implementation:** How do your tools complement each other in a security assessment workflow?

###### Were the student able to answer all the questions?

###### Did the student demonstrate a thorough understanding of the concepts and technologies used in the project?

###### Were the students able to communicate effectively and justify their decisions and explain the knowledge behind this project?

###### Was the student able to evaluate the value of this project in real-life scenarios?

###### Did the students demonstrate an understanding of ethical and legal considerations related to pentesting?

###### Did the student justify their implementation choice (single vs dual tools) with sound reasoning?

##### Check the Student Documentation in the `README.md` File

###### Does the `README.md` file contain all the necessary information about the toolkit (prerequisites, setup, configuration, usage, ...)?

###### Does the `README.md` file contain installation instructions with pip requirements?

###### Does the `README.md` file contain usage examples with command-line demonstrations for the implemented tool(s)?

###### Does the `README.md` file contain basic penetration testing methodology explanation?

###### Does the `README.md` file contain troubleshooting section for common network issues?

###### Does the `README.md` file contain clear guidelines and warnings about the ethical and legal use of the tools?

###### Does the documentation clearly explain which tool(s) were implemented and their specific purpose?

##### Review the Tool's Design and Implementation

**Note:** Evaluate based on what the student implemented (single tool or both tools).

1. **Help Command:**

```sh
$> python pentestkit.py --help
```

###### Does the output include clear explanation of how to use the toolkit with available options for the implemented tool(s)?

2. **Tool Functionality Testing:**

Test the implemented tool(s) using appropriate commands:

```sh
# For Port Scanner (if implemented)
$> python pentestkit.py -s 192.168.1.1 -o scan_results.txt

# For Directory Scanner (if implemented)
$> python pentestkit.py -d http://example.com -o dir_results.txt
```

###### Does the implemented tool(s) perform their core scanning functionality correctly?

###### Does the output get stored to the file specified in the output parameter with proper formatting?

###### Are all the tools implemented from scratch? Can you confirm that no external CLI tools are called to perform the security checks?

###### Does the toolkit demonstrate proper understanding of basic network security concepts and programming fundamentals?

###### Does the implementation show appropriate technical depth and functionality for the chosen scope?

#### Bonus

###### +Did the student implement additional valuable features such as:

- Enhanced scanning capabilities with custom configurations (port ranges, wordlists, etc.)?
- Advanced analysis features (service detection, response analysis, recursive scanning)?
- Additional security assessment tools (network mapping, header analysis, host discovery)?
- Multi-threading, asynchronous processing, or performance optimizations?
- User experience improvements (progress indicators, colored output, interactive modes)?
- Advanced reporting with security insights and recommendations?

###### +Is this project an outstanding project that exceeds the basic requirements while maintaining ethical standards?

###### +Did the student demonstrate creativity and technical depth in their bonus implementations?

###### +Does the bonus work show understanding of advanced penetration testing concepts and methodologies?

###### +Does the implementation demonstrate professional-grade features and robust architecture for the chosen scope?
