## Pick Omit

### Instructions

Create two functions which takes an object and a string or array of strings. They should return a new object which:
- `pick`: contains only those keys which appear in the string or array of strings.
- `omit`: contains only those keys which do not match the string, or do not appear in the array of strings.

> Those functions are pure and must not modify the given object
> It should ignore properties from the prototype chain
