## ascii-art-color

### Objectives

You must follow the same [instructions](https://public.01-edu.org/subjects/ascii-art/) as in the first subject but with colors.

- The output should manipulate colors using the **flag** `--color=<color>`, in which `--color` is the flag and `<color>` is the color name of choice (ex: orange, green, blue).
- The colors must respect the [RGB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RGB_color_model) concept.
- You should be able to specify a single or a set of letters you want to be colored (use your imagination for this one).
- If the letter isn't specified, the whole `string` should be colored.

This project will help you learn about :

- The Go file system(**fs**) API.
- RGB color model.
- Ways to receive data.
- Ways to output data.
- Manipulation of strings.
- Manipulation of colors on the terminal.
- Manipulation of structures.

### Instructions

- Your project must be written in **Go**.
- The code must respect the [**good practices**](https://public.01-edu.org/subjects/good-practices/).
- It is recommended that the code should present a **test file**.

### Allowed packages

- Only the [standard go](https://golang.org/pkg/) packages are allowed
