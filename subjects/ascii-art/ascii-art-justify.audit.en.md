#### Basic

###### *Has the code passed the formatting? (gofmt, goimports)
###### *Does the project runs quickly and effectively? (Favoring recursive, no unnecessary data requests, etc)

###### *Does the code present commenting (https://github.com/01-edu/public/blob/master/subjects/good-practices.en.md)?
###### *Does the code present documentation?
###### *Does it present consistent indentation?
###### *Does the code avoid obvious comments (no over information)?
###### *Does the code avoid code grouping?
###### *Does the code have a consistent naming scheme (camelCase, under_scores)?
###### *Does the code obey the principles "DRY" (Don't Repeat Yourself) or "DIE" (Duplication is Evil)?
###### *Does the code obey the principal "KISS" (keep it simple, stupid)?
###### *Does the code obey the principle "YAGNI" (You Are not Gonna Need It)?
###### *Does the code obey the principle "SOC" (Separation of Concerns)?
