#### Functional

###### Has the requirement for the allowed packages been respected? (Reminder for this project: only [standard packages](https://golang.org/pkg/))

> For consistency, use bash for the following tests.

##### Try passing as arguments `--align right something standard`

```
Usage: go run .  [OPTION] [STRING] [BANNER]

Example: go run . --align=right  something  standard
```

###### Does it display the same result as above?

##### Try passing as arguments `--align=right left standard`

###### Does it display the correct result at the right side?

##### Try passing as arguments `--align=left right standard `

###### Does it display the correct result at the left side?

##### Try passing as arguments `--align=center hello shadow`

###### Does it display the correct result at the center?

##### Try passing as arguments `--align=justify "1 Two 4" shadow`

###### Does it display the correct result justified?

##### Try passing as arguments `--align=right 23/32 standard`

###### Does it display the correct result at the right side?

##### Try passing as arguments `--align=right ABCabc123 thinkertoy`

###### Does it display the correct result at the right side?

##### Try passing as arguments `--align=center "#$%&\"" thinkertoy`

###### Does it display the correct result at the center?

##### Try passing as arguments `--align=left '23Hello World!' standard `

###### Does it display the correct result at the left side?

##### Try passing as arguments `--align=justify 'HELLO there HOW are YOU?!' thinkertoy`

###### Does it display the correct result justified?

##### Try passing as arguments `--align=right "a -> A b -> B c -> C" shadow `

###### Does it display the correct result at the right side?

##### Try reducing the terminal window and run `--align=right abcd shadow `

###### Does the representation adapt to the terminal size displaying the right result in the right side?

##### Try reducing the terminal window and run `--align=center ola standard `

###### Does the representation adapt to the terminal size displaying the right result in the center?

##### Try passing as arguments a random string with lower and upper case letters, and the align flag ("--align=") followed by a random alignment (left, right, center or justify).

###### Does it display the expected result?

##### Try passing as arguments a random string with lower case letters, numbers and spaces, and the align flag ("--align=") followed by a random alignment (left, right, center or justify).

###### Does it display the expected result?

##### Try passing as arguments a random string with special characters, and the align flag ("--align=") followed by a random alignment (left, right, center or justify).
