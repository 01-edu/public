###### Does it display the expected result?
##### Try passing as arguments "(%&) ??" --color=yellow.
###### Does it display the expected result?
##### Try specifying a set of letters to be colored (the second until the last letter).
###### Does it displays the expected result (the corresponding set of letters with that color)?
##### Try specifying letter to be colored(the second letter).
###### Does it displays the expected result (the corresponding letter with that color)?
##### Try specifying letter to be colored(just two letter).
###### Does it displays the expected result (the corresponding letters with that color)?
##### Try passing as arguments "HeY GuYs" --color=orange, in order to color "GuYs".
###### Does it display the expected result?
##### Try passing as arguments "RGB()" --color=blue, in order to color just the B.
###### Does it display the expected result?
