## PerfectNum

### Instructions

Write a function that takes an integer `n` and returns `true` if it is a perfect number, and `false` otherwise. A perfect number is a positive integer that is equal to the sum of its proper divisors (excluding itself).

### Expected function

```javascript
function isPerfectNum(n) {}
```

### Usage

Here is a possible program to test your function:

```javascript
console.log(isPerfectNum(6));
console.log(isPerfectNum(28));
console.log(isPerfectNum(12));
```

And its output:

```console
$ node main.js
true
true
false
$
```
