## Mixed Feelings

Unlike feelings, mixed data can be great !

### Mixed data types

Like objects, arrays are values and so you can have arrays of arrays, or arrays
of objects, or arrays of objects with arrays in them or... well, you get the
picture.

### Instructions

You must create a `mixedFeelings` variable that is an array of 3 _emotions_.

An emotion is an object with 2 properties:

- a `type` property of value being one of the following strings `'happiness'`,
  `'sadness'`, `'disgust'`, `'fear'`, `'surprise'` or `'anger'`
- a `level` property of value being a number from `0-9`
