#### Functional

##### Try to run the application.

###### Does the application start?

##### Try to generate a vehicle by pressing the `"Arrow Up"` key.

###### Was a vehicle generated from the south, with a random route?

##### Try to generate a vehicle by pressing the `"Arrow Down"` key.

###### Was a vehicle generated from the north, with a random route?

##### Try to generate a vehicle by pressing the `"Arrow Right"` key.

###### Was a vehicle generated from the west, with a random route?

##### Try to generate a vehicle by pressing the `"Arrow left"` key.

###### Was a vehicle generated from the east, with a random route?

##### Try pressing the `"r"` key.

###### Was the vehicle generated from a random direction, with a random route?

##### Try pressing the `"r"` key more than 5 times to generate multiple vehicles, from multiple directions.

###### Can you confirm that the vehicles were created and maintain a safe distance from one another?

##### Try to generate three vehicles from the same direction. Do this for each of the four directions.

###### Can you confirm that the vehicles were created and maintain a safe distance from one another?

##### Try to generate two vehicles at the same time, one using the `"Up"` key and the other using the `"Down"` key (do this at least 3 times).

###### Did all the vehicles pass through the intersection without any collisions?

##### Try to generate two vehicles at the same time, one using the `"Right"` key and the other using the `"Left"` key (do this at least 3 times).

###### Did all the vehicles pass through the intersection without any collisions?

##### Try to generate two vehicles at the same time, one using the `"Up"` key and the other using the `"Left"` key (do this at least 3 times).

###### Did all the vehicles pass through the intersection without any collisions?

##### Try to generate two vehicles at the same time, one using the `"Up"` key and the other using the `"Right"` key (do this at least 3 times).

###### Did all the vehicles pass through the intersection without any collisions?

##### Try to generate two vehicles at the same time, one using the `"Down"` key and the other using the `"Left"` key (do this at least 3 times).

###### Did all the vehicles pass through the intersection without any collisions?

##### Try to generate two vehicles at the same time, one using the `"Down"` key and the other using the `"Right"` key (do this at least 3 times).

###### Did all the vehicles pass through the intersection without any collisions?

##### Try to generate five vehicles using the `"Up"` key, at the same time generate two vehicles using the `"Right"` key.

###### Did all the vehicles pass through the intersection without any collisions?

##### Try to generate one vehicle for all the lanes (do this at least 3 times).

###### Did all the vehicles pass through the intersection without any collisions?

##### Try to generate many vehicles randomly using the `"r"` key. Then wait for at least 1 min.

###### Did all the vehicles pass through the intersection without any collisions?

##### Try to generate many vehicles in lanes of your choice.

###### Did all the vehicles pass through the intersection without any collisions?

##### Try pressing the `"Esc"` key.

###### Was the simulation ended?

###### High traffic congestion is when there are 8 or more vehicles in the same lane without proceeding. Was there low traffic congestion while running the simulation?

#### General

###### Can you confirm that it is impossible to spam the creation of vehicles by pressing the arrow keys too many times or leave one pressed?

##### Ask the captain of the raid to show you information about how the color of cars relates to its random route.

###### Was the information about colors and routes available?

###### Are vehicles assigned to their own route with an appropriate color? If so, do they obey that route?

###### Do the vehicles keep a safe distance by avoiding a collision when the car in front stops?

###### Do vehicles stop whenever there is a red light?

###### Do vehicles proceed whenever there is a green light?

#### Bonus

###### +Is there any type of image sprite for traffic light? (An image sprite is a collection of images put into a single image.)

###### +Did the student implement some kind of animation and image sprite for the vehicle?

###### +Did the student implement more features than those in the subject?
