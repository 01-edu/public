###### Are vehicles generated randomly(random lane and route)?

##### Try to generate tree vehicles in the same lane (do this to all lanes).

###### Did all vehicles passed the intersection safely?

##### Try to generate two vehicles at the same time, one using the `"Up"` key and the other using the `"Down"` key (to this at least 3 times).

###### Did all vehicles passed the intersection safely?

###### Did all vehicles passed the intersection safely?

###### Was there a low traffic congestion while running the application? (ex: high traffic congestion can be 8 or more vehicles in the same lane without proceeding)?

##### Try to generate vehicles with lanes at your choice.

###### Did all vehicles passed the intersection safely?

#### General

###### Is it not possible to spam the creation of vehicles(by pressing the arrow keys to many times)?

###### Are vehicles assigned to their own route, and if so do they obey that route? (ex: r0 must turn left, r2 must turn right)

###### Are vehicles kept in a safe distance(do not collide when ever one stops)?

###### Do vehicles stop when ever there is a red light?

###### Do vehicles proceed when ever there is a green light?

#### Bonus

###### +Is there any type of image sprite for traffic light?

###### +Did the student implement some kind of animation and image sprite for the vehicle?

###### +Did the student implement more features than those in the subject?
