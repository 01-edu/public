### Instructions

Isaac Newton has forgotten his laws of physics and needs your help to animate an object on his game.
He must use the Second Law of Motion that states, when the forces acting on an object are unbalanced, the object will accelerate.
This acceleration is dependent upon the force that act upon the object and the object's mass.

So he wants to know for an object with :

- mass of xx
- Δv of xx
- Δt of xx
- force of xx
- distance xx
- time xx

whats the acceleration of that object.
Create a function called `getAcceleration` that given an object with the values of `{ f: 10, m: 5, Δv: 100, Δt: 50, t:1, d: 10 }`
it must calculate the acceleration. If its not possible to calculate it you must return the string `impossible`

### Formulas

```
a = F/m
a = Δv/Δt
a = 2d/t^2

a = acceleration
F = force
Δv = final velocity - initial velocity
Δt = final time - initial time
d = distance
t = time
```

Truth is ever to be found in simplicity, and not in the multiplicity and confusion of things
