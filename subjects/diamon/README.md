## ðŸŒŸ Diamon

### Instructions

Create a `diamon` function that takes a string and a number as parameters
and returns a diamond shape constructed by 2 arguments:
 - the characters (as a string) to be repeated
 - the size of a side (as a number)

It is just like pyramid + a reversed pyramid

### Output example
