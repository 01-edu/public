## Greedy Url

### Instructions

Write 3 functions :

- `getURL` that returns an array with all valid URLs present in a data-set, http and https
- `greedyQuery` that returns URL with at least 3 or more parameters from all URLs that contain a query.
- `notSoGreedy` that returns URL with at least 2, but not more then 3 parameters from all URLs that contain a query.

You can search for greedy quantifiers for help
