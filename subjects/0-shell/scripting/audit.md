#### General

###### Was the project written in a compiled programming language?

###### Was the student shell script created?

#### Functional

##### Try to run the student script in your computer terminal and create the directory "Example".

```
Enter directory name
Example
Directory created
```

###### Can you confirm that the script is valid and the directory "Example" was created like in the example above?

##### Try to run the student script in the `0-shell` interpreter and create the directory "Example1".

```
Enter directory name
Example1
Directory created
```

###### Can you confirm that the script is valid and the directory "Example1" was created like in the example above?

##### Try to run the student script in the `0-shell` interpreter and create the directory with the same name as before "Example1".

```
Enter directory name
Example1
Directory exist
```

###### Can you confirm that the directory was not created and the script shows the message "Directory exist" because a directory with that name already exists like in the example above?

##### Try to run the command `"NAME="Alex""` followed by the command `"echo "Hello $NAME!""` in the `0-shell` interpreter.

```
Hello Alex!
```

###### Can you confirm that the script was validated and the project displayed the message as the example above?

##### Try to run the command `"for ((i = 0 ; i < 5 ; i++)); do echo $i; done"` followed by the command `"echo "Hello $NAME!""` in the `0-shell` interpreter.

```
0
1
2
3
4
```

###### Can you confirm that the script was validated and the project displayed the message as the example above?

##### Try to run the command `"echo "I'm in $(pwd)""` in the `0-shell` interpreter. Do the same in your computer terminal in the same folder.

###### Can you confirm that the script was validated and the project displayed the same message in both terminals?
