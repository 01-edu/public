## reversebits

## **WARNING! VERY IMPORTANT!**

For this exercise a function will be tested **with the exam own main**. However the student **still needs** to submit a structured program:

This means that:

- The package needs to be named `package main`.
- The submitted code needs one declared function main(```func main()```) even if empty.
- The function main declared needs to **also pass** the `Restrictions Checker`(illegal functions tester). It is advised for the student to just empty the function main after its own testings are done.
- Every other rules are obviously the same than for a `program`.

### Instructions

Write a function that takes a `byte`, reverses it, `bit` by `bit` (like the
example) and returns the result.

### Expected function

```go
func ReverseBits(oct byte) byte {

}
```

Example:

  1 byte

 0010  0110
