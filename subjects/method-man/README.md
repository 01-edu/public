## Method Man

### Instructions

Write 5 functions:

- `words`: that takes a string, splits it by spaces, and returns an array of those substrings.
- `sentence`: that takes an array of strings, and joins them with spaces to return a single string.
- `yell`: that takes a string and returns it in upper case.
- `whisper`: that takes a string and returns it in lower case, surrounded by `*`.
- `capitalize`: that takes a string and transforms it so that the first character is upper case, and the subsequent characters are lower case.
