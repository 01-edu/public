### Instructions

Write 5 functions:

- `words` that takes a string
  and split it into an array of strings on spaces
- `sentence` that takes an array of strings and join them with spaces
- `yell` that take a string and return it in upper case
- `whisper` that take a string and return it in lower case
  and surround it with `*`
- Create a `capitalize` function that takes a string
  and transforms it to upper case only for the first letter,
  and in lowercase for the rest of the string
