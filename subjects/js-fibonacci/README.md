## fibonacci

### Instructions

Write a function that takes an `integer` `n` as an argument and returns the `n`th number in the Fibonacci sequence. The sequence starts with 0 and 1, and each subsequent number is the sum of the previous two numbers.

### Expected function

```javascript
function fibonacci(n) {}
```

### Usage

Here is a possible program to test your function:

```javascript
console.log(fibonacci(6));
console.log(fibonacci(10));
```

And its output:

```console
$ node main.js
8
55
$
```
