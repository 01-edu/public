## Filter

### Instructions

- Create a `filter` function that takes an array as first argument, a function as second,
and that works like the method [].filter

- Create a `reject` function that takes an array as first argument, a function as second,
and that works like the reject function from lodash.

- Create a `partition` function that takes an array as first argument, a function as second,
and that works like the partition function from lodash.
