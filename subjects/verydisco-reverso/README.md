## verydisco-reverso

### Instructions

Create a `verydisco-reverso.mjs` script that:

- takes the name of a file (with the extension) as a first argument
- reads this file
- deciphers the content of this file by reversing it from the `very disco` mode
- prints the result in the console

For example:

- Reading the `verydisco` content of your `verydisco.txt` file would print `discovery` in console.
