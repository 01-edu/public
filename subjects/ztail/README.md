## ztail

### Instructions

Write a program that behaves like a simplified `tail` command but which takes at least one file as argument.

- The only option to be handled is `-c`. This option will be used in all the tests as the first argument, with positive values.

- For this program the `os` package can be used.

- Handle the errors by returning a non-zero exit status.
