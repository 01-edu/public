## Index Of

### Instructions

Create 3 functions:
- `indexOf` that return the index of the first occurence of a value
- `lastIndexOf` that return the index of the last occurence of a value
- `includes` that return true if the value was found in the array

> If a value is not found, the returned index is -1

> functions should have array element as first argument
> `indexOf` and `lastIndexOf` takes an additionnal `fromIndex` argument
> that allow you to begin searching from a specific index.
