## ðŸŒŸ Unchanging

You are now begining **BONUS** exercises, those are made to make you explore JS
a bit more by yourself and show you more obscure / weird aspects of the
language.

**Only spend time on those if you are ahead !**

If you feel already a bit overwhelmed by all you had to learn so far, don't feel
bad to skip them.

### Instructions

Declare a variable `unchanging` of the value of your choice, but you must make
sure it can not be re-assigned.
