### Instructions

You are now a butter passer, calculator, and barttender all-in-one robot. You
want to keep on improving but you can feel like your memory capacities are
reaching their limits. You will now try to improve what you aready have.

Declare the function `addAll` which will will return the sum of all the
arguments it recieves. Examples:

```js
console.log(addAll(1)) //1
console.log(addAll(1, 10)) //11
console.log(addAll(1, 10, 100)) //111
```

You will then do exactly the same for `subAll`, `MultAll` and `divAll`.
