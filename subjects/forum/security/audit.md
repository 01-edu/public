#### Functional

##### Try opening the forum.

###### Does the URL contain HTTPS?

###### Is the project implementing [cipher suites](https://www.iana.org/assignments/tls-parameters/tls-parameters.xml)?

###### Is the Go TLS structure well configured?

###### Is the [server](https://golang.org/pkg/net/http/#Server) timeout reduced (Read, write and IdleTimeout)?

###### Does the project implement [Rate limiting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rate_limiting) (avoiding [DoS attacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denial-of-service_attack))?

##### Try to access the database.
