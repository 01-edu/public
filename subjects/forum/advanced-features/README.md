### Objectives

You must follow the same [principles](https://public.01-edu.org/subjects/forum/forum.en) as the first subject.

In `forum advanced features`, you will have to implement the following features :

- You will have to create a way to notify users when their posts are :

  - liked/disliked
  - commented

- You have to create an activity page that tracks the user own activity. In other words, a page that :

  - Shows the user created posts
  - Shows where the user left a like or a dislike
  - Shows where and what the user has been commenting. For this, the comment will have to be shown, as well as the post commented

- You have to create a section where you will be able to Edit/Remove posts and comments.

We encourage you to add any other additional features that you find relevant.
