## Has City

### Instructions

Create a function `hasCity` that takes a string called `country` and a array of strings named `cities`,
which returns a new function. \
The new function takes a string called `city` as a parameter which returns
whether the string is part of the `cities` array or not.

If it is, it should return the string `<city> is a city from <country>`, otherwise
`<city> is not a city from <country>`.
