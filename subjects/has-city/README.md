## Has City

### Instructions

Create a function `hasCity` that takes a string called `country` and an array of strings, which are cities of that country, which returns a new function.
The new function takes a string, called `city`, as a parameter and which determines
whether the array contains that string or not.

If it does, it should return the string `<city> is a city from <country>`, otherwise
`<city> is not a city from <country>`.
