## Get Some Time

### Instructions

Create a function named `firstDayWeek`, which accepts a specific week in a given year:
- `number`: representing a week of the year (between 1 and 53).
- `string`: representing a year.

Your function should return a `string` representing the date of the first day of that specific week in the format `dd-mm-yyyy`.

Week `1` is in all cases, the week which contains the 1st of January.

The first day of a week is a Monday.

If the start of the week is in the previous year, then your function should return the first day of the specified year.
