## **WARNING! VERY IMPORTANT!**

For this exercise a function will be tested **with the exam own main**. However the student **still needs** to submit a structured program:

This means that:

- The package needs to be named `package main`.
- The submitted code needs one declared function main(`func main()`) even if empty.
- The function main declared needs to **also pass** the `Restrictions Checker`(illegal functions tester). It is advised for the student to just empty the function main after its own testings are done.
- Every other rules are obviously the same than for a `program`.

### Instructions

Write a function that separates the words of a `string` and puts them in a `string` array.

The separators are the characters of the `charset string` given in parameter.

### Expected function

```go
func Split(str, charset string) []string {

}
```

### Usage

Here is a possible program to test your function :

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	piscine ".."
)

func main() {
	str := "HelloHAhowHAareHAyou?"
	fmt.Println(piscine.Split(str, "HA"))
}
```

And its output :

```console
student@ubuntu:~/[[ROOT]]/test$ go build
student@ubuntu:~/[[ROOT]]/test$ ./test
[Hello how are you?]
student@ubuntu:~/[[ROOT]]/test$
```
