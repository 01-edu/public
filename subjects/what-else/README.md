## What else ?

### The `else` keyword

It allows to execute alternative code if the condition do not match:

```js
if (isEnough) {
  console.log('this is enough :)')
} else {
  console.log('I want more !!')
}
```

it is like an `if` but you don't have a condition, just add a scope after `{}`
and write code !

### Instructions

`'The only failure is not to try.'`
