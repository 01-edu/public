## bomberman-dom

You certainly know bomberman right? Good good. You will make it. Relax, is not that hard, it is only a multiplayer version of it. Ah and forgot to mention that you will need to do it using the framework you created a while ago. Let me explain.

### Objectives

For this project you have to create a [bomberman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bomberman) alike game, where multiple players can join in a same room and battle until one of them is the last man standing.

### Instructions

When the user opens the game, he/she should be presented to a page where he/she should enter a nickname to differentiate users. After selecting a nickname the user should be presented to a waiting page with a player counter that ends at 4. Once a user joins a room, the player counter will increment by 1. As soon as there are 4 players in the room, the game starts.

#### Beginning of the game

In the beginning there was 4 players, and only one came out alive. Each player will have to start in the different corners of the map.
