## bomberman-dom

You certainly know [bomberman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bomberman) right? Good good. You will make it. Relax, is not that hard, it is only a multiplayer version of it. Ah and forgot to mention that you will need to do it using the framework you created a while ago. Let me explain.

### Objectives

For this project you have to create a bomberman alike game, where multiple players can join in and battle until one of them is the last man standing.

### Instructions

In the beginning there was 4 players, and only one came out alive. Each player will have to start in the different corners of the map and only one will be victorious.

You will have to follow more a less the same principles has the [make-your-game](https://public.01-edu.org/subjects/make-your-game/) project. But we will refresh some of the concepts you will have to respect and deal with.

1. [**Performance**](https://public.01-edu.org/subjects/good-practices/), is one of the most important aspects while developing a game, so lets respect it.\
   Just like make-your-game you will have to respect the policy of:

- Running the game at least at **60fps** at all time
- No frame drops
- Proper use of [**`requestAnimationFrame`**](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/window/requestAnimationFrame)
- Measuring performance to know if your code is fast

You must not use canvas neither [Web-GL](https://get.webgl.org/) or other framework, for this project you will use the framework you did on the [mini-framework](https://public.01-edu.org/subjects/mini-framework/) project.

When the user opens the game, he/she should be presented to a page where he/she should enter a **nickname** to differentiate users. After selecting a nickname the user should be presented to a waiting page with a **player counter** that ends at 4. Once a user joins, the
player counter will increment by 1. As soon as there are 4 players, the game starts.

#### Game Mechanics

1. Players

   1. NÂº of players: 2 - 4
   2. Each player must have 3 lives. Then you are out!!

2. The map should be fixed so that every player sees the whole map.

   1. The maps should be generated randomly. There will be two types of blocks, the ones that can be destroyed and the the ones that can not.

3. Power ups (each power up must appear randomly after a block is destroyed):

   1. Bombs: Increases the amount of bombs dropped at a time by 1;
   2. Flames: Increases explosion range from the bomb in four directions by 1 square;
   3. Speed: Increases movement speed;
   4. Bomb Push: Ability to throw a bomb after it has been placed.
