### Objectives

Technology nowadays continue to evolve. Has a programmer or developer you must be updated with this exponential evolution of technology.

This is where tech news shines, just like Hacker News where you can see all about new technology, jobs and much more, but some websites do not perform very well or their aren't so user friendly.

So your objective for this raid is to create an UI for [`HackerNewsAPI`](https://github.com/HackerNews/API).

You must handle at lest:

- [stories](https://github.com/HackerNews/API#ask-show-and-job-stories)
- [jobs](https://github.com/HackerNews/API#ask-show-and-job-stories)
- [polls](https://github.com/HackerNews/API#items)
- [comments](https://github.com/HackerNews/API#items)

[Live Data](https://github.com/HackerNews/API#live-data) : is one of the features from this Hacker News API, you can handle requests so that the news you provide is updated.
Currently this API does not present [rate limit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rate_limiting). But that doesn't mean you should abuse/overload the API!!!

Best ways you can avoid rate limiting :

- optimize your code to eliminate any unnecessary requests
- usage of throttling/debouncing function to regulates the amount of requests

### Optional

You can handle sub-comments for each stories, jobs and polls this meaning nested comments
