## Sums

### Instructions

Create a function called `sums` that receives a number and returns its
partitions.
A partition of a number is a group of numbers that its sum is equal to that
number.
Sums must ignore duplicates ([1,2] and [2,1] are duplicates).

Example:
sums(4) = [[1, 3], [2, 2], [1, 1, 2], [1, 1, 1, 1]]
