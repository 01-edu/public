## reverserange

### Instructions

Write the function ReverseRange which must:

- allocate (with make()) an array of integers.
- fill it with consecutive values that begin at `end` and end at `start` (Including `start` and `end` !)
- finally return that array.

### Expected function

```go
func ReverseRange(start, end int) []int {

}
```

Examples of output :

- With (1, 3) the function will return an array containing 3, 2 and 1.
- With (-1, 2) the function will return an array containing 2, 1, 0 and -1.
- With (0, 0) the function will return an array containing 0.
- With (0, -3) the function will return an array containing -3, -2, -1 and 0.
