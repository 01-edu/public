### Instructions

A little voice speaks in your head:

"Now that you know who you are. You need to remember what you can do..."

The instincts are coming back...

Put in a file `mastertheLS` the command line that will:

- list the files and directories of the current directory.
- Ignore the hidden files, the "." and the "..".
- Separate the results with commas **only**.
- Order them by ascending order of access time (the newest first).
- Have the directories ends with a `/`.

### Hint

Read the man...
