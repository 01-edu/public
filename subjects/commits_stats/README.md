## commits_stats

### Instructions:

In this exercise you will be provided with a json file `commits.json` with data corresponding to git commits in GitHub (extracted using the GitHub rest API). Your objective is to extract the relevant data and place it in a struct called `CommitData` to get the following information:

1. Number of commits per author (identified by the GitHub login).

2. The number of commits per author.

Create two functions:

- `commits_per_author`: which returns a hash map with the number of commits per author.

- `commits_per_date`: which returns a hash map with the number of commits per week.

  - Note: A week is represented by the a year followed by the number of the
    week. For example, January 1, 2020 is in week 1 of 2020 and will be
    represented by a String with the form "2020-W1".

### Notions:

- [chrono](https://docs.rs/chrono/0.4.19/chrono)
- [json](https://docs.rs/json/0.12.4/json/index.html)

### Expected functions

```rust
pub fn commits_per_week(data: &json::JsonValue) -> HashMap<String, u32> {
}

pub fn commits_per_author(data: &json::JsonValue) -> HashMap<String, u32> {
}
```

### Usage

Here is a possible test for your function:

```rust
use commits_stats::{commits_per_week, commits_per_author};

fn main() {
	let contents = fs::read_to_string("commits.json").unwrap();
	let serialized = json::parse(&contents).unwrap();
	println!("{:?}", commits_per_week(&serialized));
	println!("{:?}", commits_per_author(&serialized));
}
```

And its output:

```console
student@ubuntu:~/[[ROOT]]/test$ cargo run
{"2020-W44": 5, "2020-W36": 1, "2020-W31": 1, ... ,"2020-W45": 4, "2020-W46": 4}
{"homembaixinho": 2, "mwenzkowski": 3, ... ,"tamirzb": 1, "paul-ri": 2, "RPigott": 1}
student@ubuntu:~/[[ROOT]]/test$
```
