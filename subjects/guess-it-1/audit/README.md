#### Functional

##### After downloading [this zip file](https://assets.01-edu.org/guess-it/guess-it-dockerized.zip) containing a tester, follow its instructions (present in the README) in order to test the student program against the `big-range` program 3 times using the `Data 1`.

###### Did the student won against `big-range` most of the times (at least 2 out of 3 times)?

##### Try running the student program against the `big-range` program, using `Data 2` and then `Data 3` 3 times each.

###### Did the student won against `big-range` most of the times (at least 2 out of 3 times for each)?

##### Try running the student program against the `average` program, using `Data 1`, `Data 2` and `Data 3` 3 times each.

###### Did the student won against `average` most of the times (at least 2 out of 3 times for each)?

##### Try running the student program against the `median` program, using `Data 1`, `Data 2` and `Data 3` 3 times each.

###### Did the student won against `median` most of the times (at least 2 out of 3 times for each)?

#### Bonus

##### Try running the student program against the `nic` program, using `Data 1`, `Data 2` and `Data 3` 3 times each.

###### +Did the student won against `nic` most of the times (at least 2 out of 3 times for each)?
