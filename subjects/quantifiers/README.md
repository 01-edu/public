## Quantifiers

### Instructions

Create these functions which receive an array and a function each. Each element will return `true` if
- `every`: every element in the array respects the condition of the function.
- `some`: that returns `true` if at least one element in the array respects the condition of the function.
- `none`: that returns `true` if **none** of the elements in the array respects the condition of the function.

The use of `[].every` and `[].some` is forbidden for this exercise.
