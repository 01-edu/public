## Quantifiers

### Instructions

Create three functions that receive an array and a function each:

- `every` that returns true if every element of the array respects the
  condition of the received function and false otherwise.
- `some` that returns true if at least one element of the array respects the
  condition of the received function and false otherwise.
- `none` that returns true if none of the elements of the array respects the
  condition of the received function and false otherwise.

The use of `[].every` and `[].some` is forbidden for this exercise.
