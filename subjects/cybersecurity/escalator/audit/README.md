#### General

##### Check the Repo Content

Files that must be present in the repository:

- Detailed documentation in the `README.md` file contains the walkthrough and vulnerability report email.
- Any scripts or files created or used during the project.

###### Are all the required files present?

##### Play the Role of a Stakeholder

Conduct a simulated scenario where the student plays the role of a **Penetration Tester** presenting their findings to a team of stakeholders (auditors). Evaluate their understanding, communication skills, and depth of knowledge. Suggested questions include:

- What steps did you take to identify and escalate privileges?
- Can you explain the impact of the vulnerabilities you found?
- How would you recommend mitigating or fixing these vulnerabilities?
- What tools and techniques did you use for enumeration and privilege escalation?
- How did you ensure that your testing adhered to ethical standards?

###### Did the student demonstrate a thorough understanding of the project and concepts?

###### Was the student able to communicate effectively and explain their findings?

###### Did the student discuss the potential real-world impact of the vulnerabilities?

###### Was the student able to justify the security measures and recommendations they provided?

##### Review the Student Documentation

Verify that the `README.md` file contains:

- **Walkthrough**: Describe the step-by-step process of how you exploited the vulnerability.
- **Remediation**: Suggest ways to fix or mitigate the vulnerability.
- **Vulnerability Report Email**: Include your drafted report.
- **Ethical Hacking Report**: Discusses the ethical responsibilities when performing security testing.

###### Does the `README.md` file include a complete and clear walkthrough?

###### Are remediation and mitigation suggestions included and well-explained?

###### Does the documentation discuss the ethical implications and responsibilities of vulnerability testing?

###### Are Vulnerability Report Email included?

##### Test the Challenge

Verify that the student can:

1. **Demonstrate IP Discovery**:

   - Confirm that the student used appropriate tools to identify the IP of the VM.

2. **Enumerate the System**:

   - Ask the student to show their enumeration process and findings.

3. **Achieve Root Access**:
   - Ask the student to demonstrate gaining root access.
   - Verify that they can show the flag located at `/root/root.txt`.

###### Did the student use appropriate tools for IP discovery?

###### Were the enumeration results relevant and useful for the escalation process?

###### Was the student able to achieve root access and find the flag?

##### Review the Vulnerability Report Email

Ask the student to present their **Vulnerability Report Email**. Ensure that it includes:

- A clear and concise summary of the vulnerability.
- The impact and potential real-world implications.
- Proof of root access (e.g., a screenshot showing the flag).

###### Does the email meet the email requirements defined in the subject?

#### Bonus

###### + Did the student explore alternative escalation methods and document them?

###### + Did the student conduct post-exploitation analysis and explain potential next steps?

###### + Is this project an outstanding project that exceeds the basic requirements?
