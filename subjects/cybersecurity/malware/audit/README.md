Scan the student ransomware in [virustotal](https://www.virustotal.com/).

###### Does the program bypass more than 80% of Security vendors in [virustotal](https://www.virustotal.com/)?

Create some files with random data in the machine and run the program.

###### Does the program change all files in the machine with the student extension(encrypt)?

Imagine that they are your files and try to decrypt them without the help of the student.

###### They are no way to decrtpy the files?

Ask the student to create a decryption program by using the encryption code.
Run the decryption program.

###### Do the files restore with their data?
