#### General

##### Check the Repo Content

Files that must be inside the repository:

- Detailed documentation in the `README.md` file contains exploit reports and ethical hacking reports documenting the vulnerabilities found.

###### Are all the required files present?

##### Play the Role of a Stakeholder

Organize a simulated scenario where the student takes on the role of a **Security Consultant** or **Penetration Tester** and explains their findings and reports to a team or stakeholder. Evaluate their grasp of the vulnerabilities, their remediation, communication skills, and critical thinking about the solutions provided.

Suggested role-play questions include:

- What vulnerabilities did you find, and why are they significant?
- What methods did you use to exploit the vulnerabilities in OWASP Juice Shop?
- How would these vulnerabilities impact a real-world web application?
- What are the most common security controls that could prevent these types of attacks?
- How would you explain the business impact of these vulnerabilities to a non-technical stakeholder?
- How would you propose fixes for the vulnerabilities you found?

###### Did the students demonstrate a thorough understanding of the vulnerabilities and their remediation?

###### Were the students able to communicate effectively and justify their decisions?

###### Did the students provide solutions that could be applied in a real-world environment?

##### Check the Student Documentation and the Exploit Reports in the `README.md` File

For each vulnerability report, ensure the following:

1. **Vulnerability Type**:

- Is the vulnerability correctly identified (e.g., SQL Injection, XSS, etc.)?

2. **Steps to Exploit**:

- Does the report clearly outline how the vulnerability was discovered and exploited?
- Are the steps easy to follow and reproducible?

3. **Impact**:

- Does the report clearly explain the potential impact of the vulnerability on the web application?
- Is the severity of the vulnerability assessed correctly?

4. **Remediation**:

- Are clear and actionable remediation steps provided?
- Are the recommended fixes practical and aligned with security best practices?

###### Are all the reported vulnerabilities in the README.md file respecting the questions above?

###### Does the `README.md` file include the ethical hacking report that outlines the ethical responsibilities and legal considerations followed during the project?

##### Ensure the student finds at least 5 vulnerabilities related to OWASP Top 10

###### Did the students successfully find at least 5 vulnerabilities related to OWASP Top 10, such as:

1. SQL Injection (SQLi)
2. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
3. Broken Authentication
4. Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)
5. Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)

###### Were the vulnerabilities explained and exploited successfully?

##### Demonstrate the vulnerabilities

Ask the students to demonstrate their exploitation techniques and walk you through how they found and exploited the vulnerabilities.

###### Can the students reproduce the vulnerability using their documented steps?

###### Is the vulnerability successfully exploited in the demonstration?

###### Can the students explain how their fix improves security?

#### Bonus

###### Did the student take on any bonus tasks?

###### + Did the student identify and document an extra 5 vulnerabilities?

###### + Did the student use **OWASP ZAP** or other automated tools for vulnerability scanning?

###### + Did the student analyze the Dockerfile for potential infrastructure vulnerabilities?

###### + Is this project an outstanding project that exceeds the basic requirements?
