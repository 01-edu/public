# Mal Track

"Even the lion has to defend himself against flies"
### Objective  

The goal of this project is to understand the basic operation of a computer virus on a Windows environment and simple methods to eradicate them.

### Guidelines

The purpose of this project is to create a program that will kill the [malware](./resources/mal-track(Fynloski%20sample%2C%20ON%20VM%20ONLY).zip), remove its execution from the startup of the machine, stops and removes it from the virtual machine and display the ip address of the attacker.

This project is carried out on a virtual machine (in your malware analysis lab).
You are free to choose your virtual machine, it must be windows-based. (but in the audit you will use an official windows virtual machine!)
You are free to choose the programming language for your program.
