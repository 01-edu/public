### Introduction

Malware analysis is a critical skill in cybersecurity, enabling analysts to understand and counteract malicious software. In this project, you will explore and neutralize a Windows-based malware sample in a controlled environment. The goal is to analyze the malware's behavior, develop a program to eradicate it and gather key details, including the attacker's IP address.

### Objective

This project aims to help you gain hands-on experience with malware analysis and mitigation. You will set up a Windows-based virtual machine, analyze a malware sample, and create a program to remove it effectively.

By completing this project, you will:

- Understand the fundamentals of malware analysis and behavior.
- Learn to identify and eradicate malware persistence mechanisms.
- Develop a program to neutralize malware and prevent its persistence.
- Gain experience in reverse engineering and process debugging.
- Understand the importance of secure environments for malware research.

### Role Play

As part of the project, you will participate in a role-play session where you will act as a **Malware Analyst** presenting your findings to a hypothetical team of stakeholders. Prepare to discuss:

- How did you analyze the malware and identify its behavior?
- The functionality of your program and how it eradicates the malware.
- The impact the malware could have if executed in an uncontrolled environment.
- Recommendations for mitigating similar threats in the future.
- Ethical considerations when handling and analyzing malware samples.

### Project Requirements

#### Setup and Installation

Download the provided malware sample and set up a Windows virtual machine in VirtualBox or another virtualization software.

- **Malware Sample Download Link**:
  - [Malware Sample](<./resources/Fynloski(ON VM ONLY).zip>)

> Ensure the malware is executed within a secure, isolated environment to prevent accidental spread or damage.

#### The Challenge

- **Develop a Program**: Using a programming language of your choice create a program that will:
  - Kill the malware process.
  - Remove the malware’s persistence mechanisms (e.g., from startup folders, and registry entries).
  - Stop and completely remove the malware from the virtual machine.
  - Extract and display the attacker's IP address.
- **Malware Analysis**: Study the malware's behavior, including persistence mechanisms and communication methods.

#### Malware Mitigation Report Email

Draft an email as if reporting the malware analysis results through a threat intelligence channel. The report should include a summary of the malware's behavior, proof of eradication, and a brief explanation of your program’s functionality.

**Your report should include:**

- **Subject Line**: "Malware Analysis Report: Mitigation of [Malware Name]"
- **Summary**: A concise description of the malware's behavior and impact.
- **Proof of Mitigation**: Evidence that the malware process was terminated and persistence mechanisms were removed.
- **Attacker Information**: Display the attacker's IP address.

**Example Email**:

---

**To**: security@[organization].com  
**Subject**: Malware Analysis Report: Mitigation of [Malware Name]

**Dear Security Team,**

I am writing to report the successful analysis and mitigation of [Malware Name] identified during an educational malware analysis exercise. Below are the details:

**Summary**:  
The malware exhibited persistence mechanisms by adding to the Windows startup registry and communicating with a remote server. It was also running a process under the name `[ProcessName]`.

**Proof of Mitigation**:  
The malware process was successfully terminated, and its persistence mechanisms were removed. Additionally, its file was deleted from the system.

**Attacker Information**:  
The malware communicated with the following IP address: `192.168.X.X`.

Please feel free to reach out for further clarification or additional details.

**Best regards,**  
[Your Name]  
[Your Contact Information]

### Documentation

Create a `README.md` file that includes:

- **Program Explanation**: Explain the functionality of your program and how it neutralizes the malware.
- **Walkthrough**: Describe the step-by-step process of how you analyzed and eradicated the malware.
- **Remediation**: Suggest ways to prevent similar malware infections.
- **Malware Mitigation Report Email**: Include your drafted report.
- **Ethical Hacking Report**: Discuss the ethical responsibilities when performing malware analysis. This report should cover the following points:
  1. The importance of a controlled environment for malware testing.
  2. The legal and ethical boundaries of malware analysis.
  3. The risks of executing malware outside of isolated environments.

### Bonus

If you complete the mandatory part successfully, and you still have free time, you can implement anything that you feel deserves to be a bonus, for example:

- **Dynamic Analysis Automation**: Automate the detection and removal of malware persistence mechanisms.
- **Threat Intelligence Integration**: Use APIs to gather detailed information about the malware.

Challenge yourself!

### Ethical and Legal Considerations

You are responsible for ensuring all malware analysis is conducted within a secure, isolated environment. Do not use or share the malware outside of this project. Any misuse of these techniques is strictly prohibited.

> ⚠️ Disclaimer: This project is for educational purposes only. Unauthorized use of these techniques is prohibited and may violate local laws.

### Submission and Audit

Submit the following:

- The source code of your malware removal program.
- `README.md` containing your analysis and mitigation walkthrough and your report email.

Ensure VirtualBox or equivalent software is installed for the audit.
