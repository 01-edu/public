#### Functional

##### After downloading [this zip file](https://assets.01-edu.org/guess-the-number.zip) containing a tester, follow its instructions (present in the README) in order to test the student program against the `big-range` program 3 times using the `Data 4`.

###### Did the student won against `big-range` most of the times (at least 2 out of 3 times)?

##### Try running the student program against the `big-range` program, using `Data 5` 3 times.

###### Did the student won against `big-range` most of the times (at least 2 out of 3 times for each)?

##### Try running the student program against the `linear-regr` program, using `Data 4` and `Data 5` 3 times each.

###### Did the student won against `linear-regr` most of the times (at least 2 out of 3 times for each)?

##### Try running the student program against the `correlation-coef` program, using `Data 4` and `Data 5` 3 times each.

###### Did the student won against `correlation-coef` most of the times (at least 2 out of 3 times for each)?

#### Bonus

##### +Try running the student program against the `mse` program, using `Data 4` and `Data 5` 3 times each.

###### +Did the student won against `mse` most of the times (at least 2 out of 3 times for each)?

##### +Try running the student program against the `nic` program, using `Data 4` and `Data 5` 3 times each.

###### +Did the student won against `nic` most of the times (at least 2 out of 3 times for each)?
