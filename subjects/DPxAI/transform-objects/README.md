## Transform Objects

> Mindful AI mode

### Context

Imagine your favorite robot friend with all its cool features: a type, weight, and operational status.

In JavaScript, we use objects to group these properties together, making it easy to manage and tweak our robot’s settings. Let’s see how we can modify, add, or remove properties in a JavaScript object to make our robot even cooler!

### AI-Powered Learning Techniques

`Reflective Technique:`
This type of prompt encourages the AI to help learners reflect on their understanding by asking questions and prompting them to think critically about the concepts.

Find the examples across the subject ;)

### Concepts

### Modifying Objects

Let's start with a robot object:

```js
const robot = {
  points: 0,
  code: "75lai78wn",
};
```

### Adding a New Property

Give your robot a name:

```js
robot.name = "RoboMax";
```

### Changing a Property Value

Boost your robot’s points:

```js
robot.points = 10;
```

### Removing a Property

Remove a property:

```js
robot.code = undefined;
```

#### **`Prompt Example`**:

- "How does modifying an object's property differ from adding a new property or removing an existing one?"

- "Can you think of a scenario where using an object to group related properties would be more beneficial than using separate variables?"

### Instructions

#### Task 1:

Modify the provided `robot` variable:

- Add a `model` property with the string value 'RX-78'.
- Add a `fullName` property that is the joined value of the brand and the model with a space in between.
- Add `10` to its `batteryLevel` property.

#### Task 2:

Let's move away from objects a bit, and discover a notion we will use later. `Duplicating a String with Placeholders`!

Declare a variable `duplicate` that repeats the provided variable `sentence`, separated by a comma, and adds an exclamation mark at the end.

> For example, if `sentence` is "Hello there", we expect "Hello there, Hello there!".

**What a good occasion to apply what you learned in using generative AI and documentations to understand duplicating a string with placeholders! Now you are capable to find the information everywhere;)**
