### AI-Powered Learning Techniques

As you dive into this quest, using AI tools can significantly boost your learning.

A key skill is mastering how to `Speak AI`, which means knowing how to ask AI the right questions to get the answers you need while learning.

You must understand these few easy concepts first:

> **A prompt** is a question or instruction given to a generative AI to produce a specific response or action, helping users learn or achieve a desired outcome.

> **Generative AI** is an exciting tool that helps you learn by generating new content, like texts and images, based on existing examples and your prompts, making the learning process more dynamic and engaging!

**Suggested Free Generative AI Tools:**

- [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com/)
- [Phind](https://www.phind.com/)
- [Gemini](https://gemini.google.com/)

For example:

### Metaphor Explanation Technique

This type of prompt encourages the AI to explain complex concepts using simple metaphors, making them easier to understand.

**`Prompt example`**

- "Explain what a variable is in JavaScript using a metaphor."

**How to Use It with ChatGPT:**

1. **Open your favorite Generative AI (ChatGPT as an example)**: Go to [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com/) and start a new chat session.
2. **Enter the Prompt**: Type or paste your prompt into the chat. For example, "Explain what a variable is in JavaScript using a metaphor."
3. **Review the Response**: ChatGPT will provide a metaphorical explanation. For instance:

   > "A variable in JavaScript is like a labeled jar that you can store items in. You can put different things into the jar (like numbers, strings, or objects) and label it with a name so you can easily find and use the contents later. For example: `let myJar = 'Cookies';`."

4. **Ask Follow-Up Questions and compare results with your peers**: If you need further clarification or more metaphors, you can ask follow-up questions!

Similar to this technique , we will discover in each incoming exercise, a new way to learn with AI , helping you achieve your goals with your peers

> Remember that we use AI as a tool to understand deeply the notions, and not to get ready answers! So collaborate with your peers ;)

### Task:

Write the following line of code in the code editor. Put `Yes` in between the quotes, then submit it:

```js
let ready = "";
```

You just declared a variable ! What does that mean ? Well, let's move to the next exercise where you will discover
to `declare everything`!
