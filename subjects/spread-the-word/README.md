### Instructions

Gondor needs help!

To call for help you will have to concat the provided strings and arrays;
`easternmost` (string), `easternBeacons` (array), `centerBeacon` (string),
`westernBeacons` (array) and `westernmost` (string) into the variable array
`beaconsLit` that you will declare. Only one array of burning fires must be left
at the end.

Unfortunately young hobbit, the guards are watching the `Array.concat()`, the
`Array.unshift()` and the `Array.push()` methods. You will have to find another
way...
