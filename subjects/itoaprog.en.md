##**WARNING! VERY IMPORTANT!**

For this exercise a function will be tested **with the exam own main**. However the student **still needs** to submit a structured program:

This means that:

- The package needs to be named `package main`.
- The submitted code needs one declared function main(```func main()```) even if empty.
- The function main declared needs to **also pass** the `Restrictions Checker`(illegal functions tester). It is advised for the student to just empty the function main after its own testings are done.
- Every other rules are obviously the same than for a `program`.

### Instructions

-   Write a function that simulates the behaviour of the `Itoa` function in Go. `Itoa` transforms a number represented as an`int` in a number represented as a `string`.

-   For this exercise the handling of the signs + or - **does have** to be taken into account.

## Expected function

```go
func Itoa(n int) string {

}
```
