## Material Design

### Instructions

Download [this image](https://storage.googleapis.com/gd-wagtail-prod-assets/original_images/MDA2018_inline_02.jpg) which is a snapshot of 3 screens of Lyft, and detect the order in which the layers were set.

### Deliverables

- A Figma file with the image.
- On each screen, indicate the layers order with numbers. 1 being the background image, 2 the element right on top, etc.

Don't forget to:

- Upload the Figma file on Github, labeled as follows: “Name_FirstName_DeliverableName_Date_VersionNumber”. For example, it can be labeled as “Doe_John_MidFiPrototype_05242024_V1”.
- Add a title within the file.

**Tips:**

- 2 numbers can be switched as long as the layering of layers is respected.
- Pay attention to the global aspect of the file. It must be clear, simple and easy to read. You can get inspiration [canva](https://www.canva.com/) but don’t overload your design with too much details!
