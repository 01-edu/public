### Instructions

Copy 10 elements from easyJet design system, including:

- atoms.
- molecules.
- organisms.

**Deliverable:**

- A Figma file including 10 elements from easyJet design system .

Don't forget to:

- Upload the Figma file on Github, labeled as follows: “Name_FirstName_DeliverableName_Date_VersionNumber”. For example, it can be labeled as “Doe_John_MidFiPrototype_05242024_V1”.
- Add a title within the file.

**Tips:**

- You can use Avenir Book instead of easyJet’s font.
- Explore Noun Project to get icons.
