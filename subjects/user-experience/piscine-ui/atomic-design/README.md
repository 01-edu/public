### Browsing

**Context:**

Welcome to the 2nd quest of UI!

This series of exercises is a great occasion for you to discover how libraries are made in UI, thanks to Atomic Design.

### Instructions

Among these 4 websites, make snapshots of these elements:

- 1 template.
- 1 organism.
- 1 molecule.
- 1 atom.

**Websites:**

- Alibaba.
- Booking.com.
- Easyjet App.
- Interrail.

### Deliverables

- A Figma file with 4 pages.
- On each page, a screenshot of a template, an organism, a molecule and an atom.

Don't forget to:

- Upload the Figma file on Github, labeled as follows: “Name_FirstName_DeliverableName_Date_VersionNumber”. For example, it can be labeled as “Doe_John_MidFiPrototype_05242024_V1”.
- Add a title within the file.

**Tips:**

- Pay attention to the global aspect of the file. It must be clear, simple and easy to read. You can get inspiration [canva](https://www.canva.com/) but don’t overload your design with too much details!

**Quote:**

- User Interface Design is a hybrid role and can bring together concepts from interaction design, visual design, information architecture and even Front End Development.

### Material Design

### Instructions

Download [this image](https://storage.googleapis.com/gd-wagtail-prod-assets/original_images/MDA2018_inline_02.jpg) which is a snapshot of 3 screens of Lyft, and detect the order in which the layers were set.

### Deliverables

- A Figma file with the image.
- On each screen, indicate the layers order with numbers. 1 being the background image, 2 the element right on top, etc.

Don't forget to:

- Upload the Figma file on Github, labeled as follows: “Name_FirstName_DeliverableName_Date_VersionNumber”. For example, it can be labeled as “Doe_John_MidFiPrototype_05242024_V1”.
- Add a title within the file.

**Tips:**

- 2 numbers can be switched as long as the layering of layers is respected.
- Pay attention to the global aspect of the file. It must be clear, simple and easy to read. You can get inspiration [canva](https://www.canva.com/) but don’t overload your design with too much details!

### Design system library

### Instructions

Copy 10 elements from easyJet design system, including:

- atoms.
- molecules.
- organisms.

**Deliverable:**

- A Figma file including 10 elements from easyJet design system .

Don't forget to:

- Upload the Figma file on Github, labeled as follows: “Name_FirstName_DeliverableName_Date_VersionNumber”. For example, it can be labeled as “Doe_John_MidFiPrototype_05242024_V1”.
- Add a title within the file.

**Tips:**

- You can use Avenir Book instead of easyJet’s font.
- Explore Noun Project to get icons.
- Pay attention to the global aspect of the file. It must be clear, simple and easy to read. You can get inspiration [canva](https://www.canva.com/) but don’t overload your design with too much details!

### Library for climbing addicts

### Instructions

You are part of a climbing group and volunteer to rebrand the website of your club.

Based on a moodboard, create a design system with at least 20 elements, including atoms, molecules and organisms and include multistates.

### Deliverables

- A Figma file with a moodboard for a climbing group including:

  - Pictures.
  - Colors (2 to 3 main colors).
  - Typography.

- A Figma file with a library including:

  - At least 20 graphic design elements.
  - At least one atom.
  - At least one molecule.
  - At least one organism.
  - At least 5 multistate elements.

Don't forget to:

- Upload the documents on Github, in a zip folder named “ProjectTitle_Name_FirstName”, with all project deliverables as follows: “Name_FirstName_DeliverableName_Date_VersionNumber”. For example, the first deliverable can be named as “Doe_John_MidFiPrototype_05242024_V1”.
- Add a title within all written documents.

**Tips:**

- Let’s be creative! Get inspiration from visuals before diving in.
- Feel free to get inspiration from existing design systems. Browse Dribble and the Figma community!
- Pay attention to the global aspect of the deliverables. They must be clear, simple and easy to read. You can get inspiration [canva](https://www.canva.com/) but don’t overload your design with too much details!
