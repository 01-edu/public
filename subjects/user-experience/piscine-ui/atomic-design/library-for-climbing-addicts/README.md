## Library for climbing addicts

### Instructions

You are part of a climbing group and volunteer to rebrand the website of your club.

Based on a moodboard, create a design system with at least 20 elements, including atoms, molecules and organisms and include multistates.

### Deliverables

- A Figma file with a moodboard for a climbing group including:

  - Pictures.
  - Colors (2 to 3 main colors).
  - Typography.

- A Figma file with a library including:

  - At least 20 graphic design elements.
  - At least one atom.
  - At least one molecule.
  - At least one organism.
  - At least 5 multistate elements.

Don't forget to:

- Upload the documents on Github, in a zip folder named “ProjectTitle_Name_FirstName”, with all project deliverables as follows: “Name_FirstName_DeliverableName_Date_VersionNumber”. For example, the first deliverable can be named as “Doe_John_MidFiPrototype_05242024_V1”.
- Add a title within all written documents.

**Tips:**

- Let’s be creative! Get inspiration from visuals before diving in.
- Feel free to get inspiration from existing design systems. Browse Dribble and the Figma community!
- Pay attention to the global aspect of the deliverables. They must be clear, simple and easy to read. You can get inspiration [canva](https://www.canva.com/) but don’t overload your design with too much details!
