## Radio Buttons

### Instructions

Browse the internet and find at least 5 different examples of radio buttons from websites or apps.

**Deliverable:**

- A Figma file gathering 5 screenshots of radio buttons and the respective name of each app or website.

Don't forget to:

- Upload the Figma file on Github, labeled as follows: “Name_FirstName_DeliverableName_Date_VersionNumber”. For example, it can be labeled as “Doe_John_MidFiPrototype_05242024_V1”.
- Add a title within the file.

**Tips:**

- Pay attention to the global aspect of the file. It must be clear, simple and easy to read. You can get inspiration [canva](https://www.canva.com/) but don’t overload your design with too much details!
