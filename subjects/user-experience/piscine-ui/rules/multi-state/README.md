## Multi state

### Instructions

Go to [Sony.com](http://sony.com) and observe the buttons and call to actions. When you hover or click on them, they change!

Make screenshots of the different states of buttons, menu titles, filters etc. Then, gather and organize them.

Find at least five combinations of multi state elements.

### Deliverables

- A Figma file with 5 combinations of multi state elements.

Don't forget to:

- Upload the Figma file on Github, labeled as follows: “Name_FirstName_DeliverableName_Date_VersionNumber”. For example, it can be labeled as “Doe_John_MidFiPrototype_05242024_V1”.
- Add a title within the file.

**Tips:**

- Pay attention to the global aspect of the file. It must be clear, simple and easy to read. You can get inspiration [canva](https://www.canva.com/) but don’t overload your design with too much details!
