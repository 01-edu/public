## Accessibility (App)

### Instructions

Choose an app you find particularly accessible. Find at least 3 concrete examples of accessible measures and explain how they ease the reading or perception of visual content.

### Deliverables

- A 3-page Figma file with 3 different elements from an app (it can be from 3 different apps) that are accessible. The three measures must be different.

Don't forget to:

- Upload the Figma file on Github, labeled as follows: “Name_FirstName_DeliverableName_Date_VersionNumber”. For example, it can be labeled as “Doe_John_MidFiPrototype_05242024_V1”.
- Add a title within the file.

**Tips:**

- Pay attention to the global aspect of the file. It must be clear, simple and easy to read. You can get inspiration [canva](https://www.canva.com/) but don’t overload your design with too much details!
