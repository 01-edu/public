### Audit

**Context:**

Welcome to this very last quest!

The point is to take on the role of a UX auditor. You’ll be asked to make the audit of a website or an app, and then to write a series of recommendations to improve it.

Let’s be critical, creative and impactful!

### Instructions

Run a heuristic audit on one of these 3 different websites or app:

- [https://www.ikea.com/](https://www.ikea.com/)
- [https://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/](https://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/)
- App WikiArt

Recommended steps:

- Define the scope.
  1. Know the business requirements and demographic of the end-users.
  2. Decide on which reporting tools and heuristics to use (in this case: this [heuristic evaluation checklist](https://drive.google.com/file/d/10KbfbNZA1oVS1sXbjjXLPPmdZ6nqVkdc/view)).
  3. Evaluate the experience and identify usability issues.
  4. Analyze and aggregate the data.
  5. Present the results.

### Deliverables

- A completed chart.
- A report including the 5 recommended steps described above.

Don't forget to:

- Upload the documents on Github, in a zip folder named “ProjectTitle_Name_FirstName”, with all project deliverables as follows: “Name_FirstName_DeliverableName_Date_VersionNumber”. For example, the first deliverable can be named as “Doe_John_MidFiPrototype_05242024_V1”.
- Add a title within all written documents.

**Tips:**

- Pay attention to the global aspect of the deliverables. They must be clear, simple and easy to read. You can get inspiration [canva](https://www.canva.com/) but don’t overload your design with too much details!

### Recommendations

### Instructions

Based on the audit you made in "Heuristic audit" exercise, write a set of 3 to 6 recommendations to improve heuristics and usability.

**Websites or Apps:**

- [https://www.ikea.com/](https://www.ikea.com/)
- [https://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/](https://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/)
- App WikiArt.

**Deliverable:**

- A PDF document with 3 to 6 recommendations.

Don't forget to:

- Upload the PDF document on Github, labeled as follows: “Name_FirstName_DeliverableName_Date_VersionNumber”. For example, it can be labeled as “Doe_John_MidFiPrototype_05242024_V1”.
- Add a title within the document.

**Tips:**

- Classify your recommendations in heuristic criteria.
- Pay attention to the global aspect of the document. It must be clear, simple and easy to read. You can get inspiration [canva](https://www.canva.com/) but don’t overload your design with too much details!
