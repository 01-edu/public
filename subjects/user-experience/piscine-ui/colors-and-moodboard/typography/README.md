### Deliverables

- A Figma file showing all the typographies used in each website or app.

Don't forget to:

- Upload the Figma file on Github, labeled as follows: “Name_FirstName_DeliverableName_Date_VersionNumber”. For example, it can be labeled as “Doe_John_MidFiPrototype_05242024_V1”.
- Add a title within the file.

**Tips:**

- Mind the presentation!
- Feel free to browse Google Chrome options to detect typography ;-)
- [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) is another great friend to have by your side
- Pay attention to the global aspect of the file. It must be clear, simple and easy to read. You can get inspiration [canva](https://www.canva.com/) but don’t overload your design with too much details!
