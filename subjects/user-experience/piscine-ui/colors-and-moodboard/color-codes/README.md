## Color codes

### Instructions

Go to these 7 websites and make the color palettes out of them (3 to 4 main colors).

**Deliverable:**

- A Figma file including screenshots of the main page, URL, extracted colors and the matching color codes.

Don't forget to :

- Upload the Figma file on Github, labeled as follows: “Name_FirstName_DeliverableName_Date_VersionNumber”. For example, it can be labeled as “Doe_John_MidFiPrototype_05242024_V1”.
- Add a title within the file.

**Tips:**

- You can use the document from the previous exercise to add the color codes on Figma.
- Use the Color Pipette to detect the color codes!
- Pay attention to the global aspect of the file. It must be clear, simple and easy to read. You can get inspiration [canva](https://www.canva.com/) but don’t overload your design with too much details!
