### Instructions

Create this image on Figma:

![Dashboard](Dashboard.png)

- Make sure:
  - You use symbols and variants (1 page for the Symbols one for the screen).
  - All your layers are named and organized.
  - You use overlays.
  - You use masks to change the shape of an imported image.
  - You use linear color function.

**Deliverable:**

- A Figma file with a copy of the image with Figma elements.

Don't forget to:

- Upload the Figma file on Github, labeled as follows: “Name_FirstName_DeliverableName_Date_VersionNumber”. For example, it can be labeled as “Doe_John_MidFiPrototype_05242024_V1”.
- Add a title within the file.

**Tips:**

- Fonts: Avenir.
- The frame is a desktop 1440 x 1024.
- [Figma article about Symbols and Variants](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/360056440594-Create-and-use-variants).
- You can use existing Libraries by browsing the Figma community resources.
- Pay attention to the global aspect of the file. It must be clear, simple and easy to read. You can get inspiration [canva](https://www.canva.com/) but don’t overload your design with too much details!
