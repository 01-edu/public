## Moodboard

### Instructions

Create 4 different moodboards based on these 4 briefs and extract a color palette.

**Briefs:**

- 1: A physics teacher that wants to make his website catchy for 12 year-olds.
- 2: A Sri Lankan wedding planner website that wants to breathe sobriety and modernity.
- 3: An e-commerce platform that sells West African wax and wants to feel more luxurious in its spirit to stand out.
- 4: An NGO that helps parents of kids with autism, wants to spread joy and hope for a fundraiser.

### Deliverables

- A Figma file per moodboard.
- On each moodboard, several pictures (5 to 12) that are graphically consistent in terms of colors.
- The main colors extracted and shown on the side.
- One color code per color (RGB, Hex or HSB).

Don't forget to:

- Upload the documents on Github, in a zip folder named “ProjectTitle_Name_FirstName”, with all project deliverables as follows: “Name_FirstName_DeliverableName_Date_VersionNumber”. For example, the first deliverable can be named as “Doe_John_MidFiPrototype_05242024_V1”.
- Add a title within all written documents.


**Tips:**

- [Use freely-usable images!](https://buffer.com/library/free-images/)
- Examples of moodboards (in addition, the moodboard should include the color codes):

- Pay attention to the global aspect of the deliverables. They must be clear, simple and easy to read. You can get inspiration [canva](https://www.canva.com/) but don’t overload your design with too much details!
