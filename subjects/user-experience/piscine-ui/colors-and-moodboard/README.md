### Instructions

Go to the following 7 websites and make the color palettes out of them (3 to 4 main colors).

- [https://www.komoot.com/](https://www.komoot.com/) (App)
- [https://www.airtable.com/](https://www.airtable.com/)

- [https://brave.com/es/](https://brave.com/es/)
- [https://www.ted.com/](https://www.ted.com/)

**Deliverable:**

- A Figma file including screenshots of the main page for all the 7 websites, URL and extracted colors next to the screenshots.

Don't forget to:

- Upload the Figma file on Github, labeled as follows: “Name_FirstName_DeliverableName_Date_VersionNumber”. For example, it can be labeled as “Doe_John_MidFiPrototype_05242024_V1”.
- Add a title within the file.

**Tips:**

- You can use Figma to extract the colors you need and export your file to PDF.
- Use the Color Pipette to extract the colors!
- You can show the main colors with filled squares or circles next to the screenshots.
- Mind the aesthetics of your deliverable! 1 page per site should be good.

## Color codes

### Instructions

Go to these 7 websites and make the color palettes out of them (3 to 4 main colors).

**Deliverable:**

- A Figma file including screenshots of the main page, URL, extracted colors and the matching color codes.

Don't forget to :
