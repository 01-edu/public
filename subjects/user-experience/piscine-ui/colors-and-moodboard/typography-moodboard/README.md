## Typography Moodboard

### Instructions

Find consistent typography for your moodboards from the "Moodboard" exercise.

### Deliverables

- A Figma file with 4 moodboards from the "Moodboard" exercise, and typography:

  - 1 for a title
  - 1 for a button
  - 1 for a description
  - 1 for the text

Don't forget to:

- Upload the Figma file on Github, labeled as follows: “Name_FirstName_DeliverableName_Date_VersionNumber”. For example, it can be labeled as “Doe_John_MidFiPrototype_05242024_V1”.
- Add a title within the file.

**Tips:**

- Bold, italic, normal, light, etc. are fonts, not typography.
- [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) is another great friend to have by your side
- [Example of a caption here](https://www.figma.com/file/SbQMPjfLOzg92g8YZFlrRh/UI-I---Ex-5)
- Pay attention to the global aspect of the file. It must be clear, simple and easy to read. You can get inspiration [canva](https://www.canva.com/) but don’t overload your design with too much details!
