- Please make sure you use:

  - Linear color background.
  - Groups.
  - Named and organized layers.
  - Apple design system (head bar).
  - Symbols and variants for the songs (1 page for the Symbols).

**Deliverable:**

- A Figma file with a copy of the image with Figma elements.

Don't forget to:

- Upload the Figma file on Github, labeled as follows: “Name_FirstName_DeliverableName_Date_VersionNumber”. For example, it can be labeled as Doe_John_MidFiPrototype_05242024_V1”.
- Add a title within the file.

**Tips:**

- The font is GOTHAM.
- The frame is iPhone 13 Pro Max 428 x 926 px.
- [Figma article about Symbols and Variants](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/360056440594-Create-and-use-variants).
- Pay attention to the global aspect of the file. It must be clear, simple and easy to read. You can get inspiration [canva](https://www.canva.com/) but don’t overload your design with too much details!
