## Desirability testing

### Instructions

Run a desirability test!

The point of this phase is to make sure the values and the spirit you chose for your design.

- Get back to the values and spirit you chose in the "Styleguide" exercise and extract 2 to 5 adjectives.
- Prepare a board with 25+ adjectives, randomly distributed.
- Show your design to 5 different people, and ask them to select the adjectives among the list from the board that they are inspired with.
- If the selected adjectives chosen by the users are consistent with the ones you had chosen, congratulations!
- If the selected adjectives chosen by the users are not consistent, that’s fine! Make 3 suggestions about how to make your moodboard and library evolve.

### Deliverables

- A desirability testing board with 25+ different adjectives.
- Pictures from the desirability test.
- A PDF document with the outcomes of the desirability test.
- If the outcomes are not consistent with the values, 3 suggestions on how to make the moodboard and design library evolve.

Don't forget to:

- Upload the documents on Github, in a zip folder named “ProjectTitle_Name_FirstName”, with all project deliverables as follows: “Name_FirstName_DeliverableName_Date_VersionNumber”. For example, the first deliverable can be named as “Doe_John_MidFiPrototype_05242024_V1”.
- Add a title within all written documents.

**Tips:**

- Avoid confirmation biais: don’t tell them the values and ask them to approve them!
- Good to know: Desirability testing is great to assess the impressions a design gives to the users. Whereas Usability testing is great to understand what users understand your prototype and how they navigate across the product.
- Pay attention to the global aspect of the deliverables. They must be clear, simple and easy to read. You can get inspiration [canva](https://www.canva.com/) but don’t overload your design with too much details!

- "Interaction design focuses on the design of behavior of a person’s interaction with a digital interface. It is also concerned with satisfying the needs and desires of the people who will interact with a product or service.’ Alan Cooper, About Face: The Essentials of Interaction Design
