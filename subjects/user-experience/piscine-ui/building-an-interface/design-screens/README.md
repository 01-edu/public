## Design screens

### Instructions

Based on the wireframes and your design system library, take your mid-fidelity prototype to a high-fidelity level!

Select 5 screens that will show the user flow of a customer who:

- Arrives on the homepage.
- Browses the content.
- Checks one product page.
- Adds the product to the cart.
- Checks out.

Use your components, call to actions and visuals to complete the wireframes.

### Deliverables

- 5 high-fidelity screens from Figma.

Don't forget to:

- Upload the Figma file on Github, labeled as follows: “Name_FirstName_DeliverableName_Date_VersionNumber”. For example, it can be labeled as “Doe_John_MidFiPrototype_05242024_V1”.
- Add a title within the file.

**Tips:**

- Pay attention to the global aspect of the file. It must be clear, simple and easy to read. You can get inspiration [canva](https://www.canva.com/) but don’t overload your design with too much details!
