## Design system library

### Instructions

Based on the moodboard you designed in the previous exercise "Styleguide", create a design system with at least 30 elements, including atoms, molecules and organisms, and include multistates.

### Deliverables

- A Figma file with a library including:

  - At least graphic design 30 elements.
  - At least 5 atoms.
  - At least 5 molecules.
  - At least 5 organisms.
  - At least 10 multistate variations.

Don't forget to:

- Upload the Figma file on Github, labeled as follows: “Name_FirstName_DeliverableName_Date_VersionNumber”. For example, it can be labeled as “Doe_John_MidFiPrototype_05242024_V1”.
- Add a title within the file.

**Tips:**

- Start by asking yourself what key elements may appear in an e-commerce app.
- Feel free to get inspiration from existing design systems. Browse Dribble and the Figma community!
- Pay attention to the global aspect of the file. It must be clear, simple and easy to read. You can get inspiration [canva](https://www.canva.com/) but don’t overload your design with too much details!
