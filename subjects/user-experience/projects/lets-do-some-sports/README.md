## Let's do some sports!

Creation of a sports app with data tracking on mobile and e-watch (data visualization).

Yara is a runner. She runs 5 times a week and she's passionate! She'd like to challenge her own performance to make sure she is making progress.

Yara uses an Apple Watch and her iPhone.

"I wish I could have consistent data about my trainings, more than what already exists. I can run with my watch and I'd like to analyze and share my results with my sport coach."

She asks you to design an app on a watch and on mobile that could solve her problem.

You have to meet her after two weeks to give a presentation of your work, after completing a tested high-fidelity prototype.

You'll have two phases for this project. We'll explain bellow.

**Estimated time:** 2 weeks

**Team size**: 2

**Guidelines:**

- You may consider building your UX and UI strategy before jumping in. Remember to question the initial brief with user research.
- Beware all the steps of the design process:

  - Empathy
  - Define
  - Problem Statement
  - Ideation
  - Prototype
  - Test

- You must interview or ask real people during the Empathy / User Research and Test phases.
- In both phases, you must test your prototypes with at least 5 people.

**Let’s do some sports! Phase 2, the UI**

Show a tested high-fidelity prototype.

**Guidelines:**

- Test your prototypes with at least 5 people.
- Make a presentation as if you were showing your work to Yara. Make sure there are at least 5 people in the audience.
- Prepare a feedback form to send the audience. The form must include at least the questions listed below.
- In both presentations, you are presenting to Barbara and her team.
- Timing: 20 minutes for the presentation and 10 minutes for Q&A.
- You may use the presentation audits to structure your presentations.

Don't forget to:

- Upload the documents on Github, in a zip folder named "ProjectTitle_Name_FirstName", with all project deliverables as follows: "Name_FirstName_DeliverableName_Date_VersionNumber". For example, the first deliverable can be named as "Doe_John_MidFiPrototype_05242024_V1".
- Add a title within all written documents.

### Presentation

**Final presentation audit**

Make sure:

- At least 5 people are attending the presentation
- The presentation is about the whole UX/UI process, including:

  - For the UX phase:

    - The initial brief.
    - A project planning, including the UX phases, the tools chosen, the timeline.
    - User research findings from qualitative and quantitative research (persona, figures, etc.)
    - A problem statement to adapt the initial brief based on the research findings
    - An introduction of the concept that came out of the ideation.
    - The animated mid-fidelity prototype (a demo-video).
    - The main feedback from usability testings.

- For the UI phase:

  - A project planning, including the UI phases, the tools chosen, the timeline.
  - A moodboard.
  - A styleguide (colors, branding, typography, some elements of the library).
  - The animated high-fidelity prototype (a demo-video).
  - The main feedback from usability and desirability testing.
