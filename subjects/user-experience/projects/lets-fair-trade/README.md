## Let’s fair trade

Creation of an ecommerce platform for second-hand clothes on desktop and mobile

Bruno loves fashion. He loves buying clothes! As he is cautious with the environment, he prefers buying second-hand clothing. However, the existing platforms are not very user-friendly.

"I need to know more about the environmental impact of the pieces I buy. I’d like to know how old they are, where they are coming from, to measure their life and the amount of kilometers they have traveled. When a new pair of jeans arrive at the ready-to-wear store in Europe, they consumed approximately 11,000 litres of water and traveled 65,000 kilometers. I’d like to monitor that kind of data.’

You gather a team of 3 to think and design a website and an app for second-hand products.

You have to meet Bruno after 2 weeks to give a first presentation of your work, after completing a tested mid-fidelity prototype.

The final presentation of your work will take place 2 weeks after the mid presentation, where you’ll show a tested high-fidelity prototype.

**Estimated time:** 4 weeks

**Team size:** 3 people max

**Guidelines:**

- You may consider building your UX and UI strategy before jumping in. Remember to question the initial brief with user research.
- Beware all the steps of the design process:

  - Empathy
  - Define
  - Problem Statement
  - Ideation
  - Prototype
  - Test

- You must interview or ask real people during the Empathy / User Research and Test phases.
- In both phases, you must test your prototypes with at least 5 people.

**Let’s fair trade. Phase 2, the UI**

Show a tested high-fidelity prototype.

**Guidelines:**

- Test your prototypes with at least 5 people.
- Make a presentation as if you were showing your work to Bruno. Make sure there are at least 5 people in the audience.
- Prepare a feedback form to send the audience. The form must include at least the questions listed below.
- You may use the presentation audits to structure your presentations.

Don't forget to:

- Upload the documents on Github, in a zip folder named “ProjectTitle_Name_FirstName”, with all project deliverables as follows: “Name_FirstName_DeliverableName_Date_VersionNumber”. For example, the first deliverable can be named as “Doe_John_MidFiPrototype_05242024_V1”.
- Add a title within all written documents.
- Timing: 20 minutes for the presentation and 10 minutes for Q&A.
