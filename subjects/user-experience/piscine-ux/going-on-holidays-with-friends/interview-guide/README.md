## Interview guide

**Context:**

Welcome to the 2nd quest.

Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to focus on going on holidays with friends. As you may have noticed, experiencing weekends or other kinds of holidays is super nice, but may lead to some moments of irritation.

So this project’s goal is to make holidays more comfortable fo everyone. But first, as in all design processes, you need to understand the real problem behind stressful moments!

### Instructions

You need to create an interview guide to get information from your user.

And remember, you are not your user!

**Deliverable:**

- A PDF document with an interview guide.

**Tips:**

Here are the recommended steps :

- Define your objective, what you are looking for when interviewing people. Usually, this has to do with your user's habits, and the most painful problems they have regarding this topic.
- Write down 1 to 3 hypotheses you have regarding this topic, that needs to be either confirmed or disproved.
- Pick 3 to 5 main topics you need to get information on.
- For each topic, write 1 to 3 open-ended questions with a maximum of 10 questions. Remember, your user cannot answer with “Yes” or “No!” Ex: How, Why, What, When, Tell me about the last time you did... etc. If you really need to introduce a new topic by a close-ended question, ask why right after.
- Write some screening questions to have a few pieces of demographics (age, job, location, etc.)
- Structure your questions in a funnel, start with broad questions to focus on specific topics or situations. Remember to stay neutral in your tone to let the user tell their own story. Try to focus on 10 main questions.
- Write a greeting introduction, describing briefly (1) who you are and (2) what you are looking for. No need to say too much, but enough to provide a framework and the purpose of the interview.
- Write a conclusion to thank your user for their time, and prepare the next steps. Ex: ask to be put in touch with someone they know and who could be interested in this topic, etc.
- Upload the PDF document on Github, labeled as follows: “Name_FirstName_DeliverableName_Date_VersionNumber”. For example, it can be labeled as “Doe_John_MidFiPrototype_05242024_V1”.
- Add a title within the document.
- Pay attention to the global aspect of the document. It must be clear, simple and easy to read. You can get inspiration [canva](https://www.canva.com/) but don’t overload your design with too much details!

**Quote:**

“To ask open-ended questions is the best approach, but it’s easy to get into the weeds in data analysis when every answer is a paragraph or two of prose. Users quickly tire of answering many open-ended questions, which usually require a lot of typing and explanation.” Norman Nielsen Group
