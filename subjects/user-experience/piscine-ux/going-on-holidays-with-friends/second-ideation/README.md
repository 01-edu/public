## Second Ideation

### Instructions

To find creative solutions to your problem statement, use one of these techniques in groups of 5 people, twice.

1. Gather in groups of 2. During the first run, one is the facilitator and the other is the time-keeper and in charge of logistics. Switch roles for the second run.

2. Get as many ideas as possible within a defined timeframe, and narrow them down to 3 main ideas with a voting process (in pair or in group). Take pictures!

Don't forget to:

- Upload the documents on Github, in a zip folder named “ProjectTitle_Name_FirstName”, with all project deliverables as follows: “Name_FirstName_DeliverableName_Date_VersionNumber”. For example, the first deliverable can be named as “Doe_John_MidFiPrototype_05242024_V1”.
- Add a title within all written documents.

### Deliverables

- A PDF document that includes the script with all the steps + logistics.
- Pictures of the 2 sessions.
- A PDF document with 3 ideas that came out the 2 workshops.
