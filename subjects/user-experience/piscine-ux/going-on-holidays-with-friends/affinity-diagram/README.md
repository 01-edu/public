## Affinity diagram & Empathy map

### Instructions

Open your written scripts and extract the relevant information.

1. Use paper or digital sticky notes (Post-its or Miro.com) to isolate the pieces of information your interviewees shared with you.

   **1 idea, quote, or piece of information = 1 sticky note.**

2. When all your scripts are written/typed down on sticky notes, gather them in clusters based on themes, opinions, habits, or anything they could have in common.
3. Label the clusters.
4. Draw conclusions.
5. Fill an empathy map ONLY with the content from your affinity diagram.

Don't forget to:

- Upload the documents on Github, in a zip folder named “ProjectTitle_Name_FirstName”, with all project deliverables as follows: “Name_FirstName_DeliverableName_Date_VersionNumber”. For example, the first deliverable can be named as “Doe_John_MidFiPrototype_05242024_V1”.
- Add a title within all written documents.

### Deliverables

- An Affinity Diagram (pictures of the Affinity Diagram on paper or on digital tools like Miro)
- An Empathy Map (pictures of the Empathy Map on paper or on digital tools like Miro)

**Tips:**

- Pay attention to the global aspect of the deliverables. They must be clear, simple and easy to read. You can get inspiration [canva](https://www.canva.com/) but don’t overload your design with too much details!
