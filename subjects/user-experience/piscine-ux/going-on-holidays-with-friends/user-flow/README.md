## User flow

### Instructions

Structure your main ideas into a comprehensive user flow.
You can include one, two, of the three main ideas from your previous exercise "Second Ideation" process, depending on how consistent it would be for the users.

Don't forget to:

- Upload the documents on Github, in a zip folder named “ProjectTitle_Name_FirstName”, with all project deliverables as follows: “Name_FirstName_DeliverableName_Date_VersionNumber”. For example, the first deliverable can be named as “Doe_John_MidFiPrototype_05242024_V1”.
- Add a title within all written documents.

**Deliverable:**

- A comprehensive user flow on a board (digital or pictures of a paper version).

**Tips:**

- Pay attention to the global aspect of the deliverables. They must be clear, simple and easy to read. You can get inspiration [canva](https://www.canva.com/) but don’t overload your design with too much details!
