### Instructions

Based on your previous work and your empathy map, define a problem statement that would clarify the main problem you want to tackle.

You may use the "How Might We" exercise in pairs.

- Add a title within the document.

**Deliverable:**

- A PDF document with a problem statement starting with a "How Might We"
