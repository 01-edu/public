## Prototyping

### Instructions

Develop the idea you got in the exercise `ideation`!

Design a storyboard of Pierre (or your persona) using your idea as a solution. Show all the steps with drawings on paper (6 to 12 steps).

### Deliverables

- Pictures of 1 storyboard to describe your solution, on paper.

Don't forget to:

- Upload the documents on Github, in a zip folder named “ProjectTitle_Name_FirstName”, with all project deliverables as follows: “Name_FirstName_DeliverableName_Date_VersionNumber”. For example, the first deliverable can be named as “Doe_John_MidFiPrototype_05242024_V1”.
- Add a title within all written documents.

**Tips:**

- 1 drawing per action
