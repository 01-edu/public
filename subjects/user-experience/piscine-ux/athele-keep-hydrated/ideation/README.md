## Ideation

_You can replace Pierre with your own persona._

The chosen problem statement is:

“How might we help Pierre (or your persona) measure and prepare his hydration before a race?”

Now, let’s find creative solutions!

Find 3 friends outside of the program and run a quick ideation session (20 minutes).

- What you need for an in-person ideation workshop:

  - Prepare some papers or sticky notes, stickers, a jar, and pens.
  - A closed room for 20 minutes where everyone feels comfortable.

- Directions:
  - Ask them to turn off their phones.
  - Explain the context and introduce Pierre (or your persona).
  - Explain the goal:
    - Let’s find as many solutions as possible to the question: “How might we help Pierre (or your persona) measure and prepare his hydration before a race?”, given the following constraints (unveil them one after the other: 1 minute per constraint, 1 constraint per round):
      - If Pierre was blind
      - If Pierre was a bird
      - If Pierre was a billionaire
      - If Pierre had a twin who was constantly with him
      - If Pierre was 5 years old
      - If Pierre had 5 arms
      - If Pierre was 105 years old
      - If Pierre was very clumsy
      - If Pierre was very forgetful (and lost memory every 5 minutes)
      - If Pierre was deaf
      - If Pierre was a turtle
      - If Pierre was naked
      - If Pierre couldn’t stop talking 24/7
      - If Pierre was always late
      - If Pierre was dishonest
  - Set a timer for each round.
  - Ask the participants to do, at each round, the following:
    - Write down their ideas on a sticky note (1 idea per sticky note).
    - Read them out loud.
    - Put the sticky note in a jar.
  - Gather all the ideas.
  - Give the participants 3 stickers each and ask them to vote for the best three options.
  - If there isn’t a solution that stands out of the crowd, hang them on a board and organize them according to these two parameters: easy to implement and efficient. Example in the resources.
  - Choose 1 main idea to solve the problem.

### Instructions

- Take pictures of the session.
- Create a board with all the ideas (on Miro or Figma for example).
- Highlight one main idea to solve the problem next to the board.

### Deliverables

- A zip file.

Don't forget to:

- Upload the documents on Github, in a zip folder named “ProjectTitle_Name_FirstName”, with all project deliverables as follows: “Name_FirstName_DeliverableName_Date_VersionNumber”. For example, the first deliverable can be named as “Doe_John_MidFiPrototype_05242024_V1”.
- Add a title within all written documents.
