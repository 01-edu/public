## User Journey

### Instructions

Based on your persona card, and the interview scripts, design Pierre’s user journey.

The journey must contain:

    - A timeline that show the journey of your persona step by step, before, during and after running a race divided into phases.
    - Pierre’s actions must be written on the timeline and for each action, a thought must be written and for every thought a main emotion must be present.

- Upload the Figma file on Github, labeled as follows: “Name_FirstName_DeliverableName_Date_VersionNumber”. For example, it can be labeled as “Doe_John_MidFiPrototype_05242024_V1”.
- Add a title within the file.

### Deliverables

- A Figma file with Pierre’s user journey.

**Tips:**

- You may use Figma.
- Mix up some insights and details from the interview scripts to write a journey that is consistent with Pierre’s personality.
- You can, for instance, describe Pierre’s first marathon. The first phase could be the preparation, the second phase the race itself, and the third one how he feels about the race when he has done it.
- Break down the story step-by-step and define Pierre’s actions.
- Focus on each action and define Pierre’s thoughts and main emotion among the list.
- Adapt the line to Pierre’s thoughts and emotions.
- Define the opportunities to improve Pierre’s overall experience every time you see a pain point.
- Pay attention to the global aspect of the document. It must be clear, simple and easy to read. You can get inspiration on [canva](https://www.canva.com/) but don’t overload your design with too much details!
