## User Interviews

**Context:**

Welcome to the very first quest of this program.

Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to find a way to improve athletes’ experience related to their hydration when running.

This first project is very special: you are asked to end up with a non-digital solution. As a matter of fact, innovation does not always rhyme with digital. So let’s be creative and get out of the box!

**General recommendations:**

- Get Out of the Box. Be curious. Follow design trends on YouTube, LinkedIn, in podcasts, on Instagram accounts. Explore the internet when you discover a new concept. Build your own design culture.
- Document everything you do, take notes, open a medium account to identify and show your deliverables, thoughts and feedback. It will be useful for your portfolio!
- Trust the design process. One step after another.
- Design needs to fail. 
  Failure is even a necessary step, but ideally it should happen before a product is launched, during the prototype and test phases
- Make connections. Use LinkedIn, your friends, friends of friends to frequently meet designers and ask them about how they practice design in their organization. Who know, some day they may remember you and offer you a contract!

### Instructions

- Read all the scripts very carefully.
- Extract at least 6 insights and write them down on a PDF file.
  - Insights must be either shared by several people or consistent with what other people have already experienced.
  - For each insight, name who said it.
- Upload the PDF document on Github, labeled as follows: “Name_FirstName_DeliverableName_Date_VersionNumber”. For example, it can be labeled as “Doe_John_MidFiPrototype_05242024_V1”.
- Add a title within the document.

**Definition of 'insight': A key learning from what you have seen, read or heard.**

### Deliverables

- A PDF document.

**Tips:**

- Pay attention to the global aspect of the document. It must be clear, simple and easy to read. You can get inspiration on [canva](https://www.canva.com/) but don’t overload your design with too much details!
- Examples of insights from the scripts (non-exhaustive list):

  - Runs several times a week (Joe, Nathan, Guillaume, Anaelle)
  - Doesn’t drink too much right before the race because it hurts my stomach (Nathan, Anaelle)
  - I run races with friends or peers (Joe, Nathan, Guillaume)

**Interview guide:**

- The following is the interview script used to conduct the seven user interviews.

Hello! My name is Agathe and I am conducting research about athletes and people who practice sports regularly. Hence, I'd be very happy to ask you some questions about the way you run, your habits, and the pain points you may have.

This interview will probably last 20 to 30 minutes.

Do you have any questions before we start?

Run

- What sports do you practice?
- How often do you run?
- When was the last time you went out for a run?

Races

- What was the last race you ran?
- How was it? Tell me about the experience you had.
- How did you get prepared?
- What would you have done differently? Why?

Hydration

- What do you remember about the way you hydrated?
- How did you manage your hydration?
- Have you ever found yourself in trouble due to hydration? What happened?
- What would you never do again? Why?

That's it, we went through all the questions I had.

Thank you so much for your time!

I have a last favor to ask you: is there anyone you know who runs frequently and would be available for a talk?
