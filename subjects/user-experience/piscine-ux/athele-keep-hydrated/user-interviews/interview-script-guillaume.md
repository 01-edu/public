Run

- What sports do you practice?
  - I've been practicing rugby for 10 years and I run several times a week. I got injured in 2012, followed with a bone graft which took me 3 years to recover.
- How often do you run?
  - It depends. Last November I ran 3 times in one month, whereas last week I ran 5 times. I usually run between 8 and 15 km.
- When was the last time you went out for a run?
  - Last Sunday, I ran 8 km in 45 minutes.
  - I love eating! Running gives a good way to balance. I am greedy and I love partying.
  - I always meet with someone when running: I'm a social runner! I don't have any problem with getting up early to meet with someone, but it's hard to get up if I run by myself. It's easier to stay motivated. I have three girlfriends with whom I run. Every weekend, I text the first one to know if she is available. If she is not, I text the second one and so on.

Races

- What was the last race you ran?
  - My first marathon was 6 weeks ago.
  - Before that, my last race was 5 or 6 years ago.
- How was it? Tell me about the experience you had.
  - I was very good. I ran with a friend from km 20 to 30, and a couple of friends from km 30 to 40. When I arrived, I proposed to my girlfriend. All my friends were there.
  - There was much more pressure than in any other race. I had never ran that distance. Only 2 weeks before the D-Day, I ran 30 km for the very first time. I realized only then how important it was to drink and eat all along the race.
- How did you get prepared?
  - The marathon was supposed to take place in March, and was postponed to October. Back in March, my weight was 76kg, and in September, 88kg. In the meantime, I got injured at rugby, there were the summer holidays, and I trained again in September.
  - To run 30 km 2 weeks before the marathon, I needed 3 hours. I found someone to run with me the 30 km with a marathon pace. I was so exhausted. I needed water, I needed sugar. It was so hard.
- What would you have done differently? Why?
  - I should have stopped drinking alcohol much earlier, eaten healthier much earlier, stopped partying and eaten correctly. And run short races at a fast pace.

Hydration

- What do you remember about the way you hydrated?
  - During the first 30 km race I didn't get hydrated at all. I hadn't drunk a single glass of water before going. I am used to running between 10 and 20 km and I never drink when I run that distance.
  - I hydrated when I got home, I drank a lot of water. Probably 2 or 3 liters in the afternoon. But at night I drank 2 L of beer.
- How did you manage your hydration?
  - When you reach 20 km, you're far from home. You feel dizzy, your muscles begin to contract and tighten, your legs are heavier and heavier.
  - I drink Aquareus, which is an energy drink by Coca-Cola, like Powerade, and I ate fruits, mostly bananas.
- Have you ever found yourself in trouble due to hydration? What happened?
  - Yes, during that 30-km race.
- What would you never do again? Why?
  - Above 15 km, you should go with some water and snacks.

Next race

- I want to run the next half-marathon in March. I also want to run as a "rabbitâ€™ for 10 to 15 km during the next marathon to support a friend. It's hard to maintain the same pace for 40 km, so we help each other out as 'rabbits': we run at a faster pace next to you so you can hold yours. In official races, it's tolerated.
