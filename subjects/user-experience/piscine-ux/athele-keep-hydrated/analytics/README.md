## Analytics

### Instructions

Read these articles and extract at least 5 key figures or insights that may be useful in understanding what athletes or sport practicing people experience related to hydration.

- On a PDF document, write at least 5 key figures or insights you extracted from the articles.
- Each insight or key figure should be justified by a quote and the title of the article.
- Upload the document on Github, labeled as follows: “Name_FirstName_DeliverableName_Date_VersionNumber”. For example, it can be labeled as “Doe_John_MidFiPrototype_05242024_V1”.
- Add a title within the document.

### Deliverables

- A PDF document.

**Tips:**

- Pay attention to the global aspect of the document. It must be clear, simple and easy to read. You can get inspiration on [canva](https://www.canva.com/) but don’t overload your design with too much details!

Examples of insights you can extract from the articles:

- Symptoms of dehydration can be headache, dizziness, nausea, lightheadedness, or fatigue.
- People experience dehydration when they lose 2% of their body mass loss (BML) in fluids/water/sweat.
- Sweat helps the body to maintain optimal body temperature.
- Sprint athletes are generally less concerned about the effects of dehydration than are endurance athletes.
