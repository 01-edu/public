## Problem Statement

### Instructions

Based on the insights from the exercises `analytics` and `user interviews`, comment the scope of possible problem statements.

- On a PDF document, write down one problem statement that summarizes the main problem that Pierre has when he runs.
- Upload the PDF document on Github, labeled as follows: “Name_FirstName_DeliverableName_Date_VersionNumber”. For example, it can be labeled as “Doe_John_MidFiPrototype_05242024_V1”.
- Add a title within the document.

### Deliverables

- A PDF document.

**Tips:**

- At this stage, it’s important to focus on the problem, not on the solution! You can start tackling the problem after (re)defining it.
- Several problem statements can be possible for each persona and user journey, but for this exercise, we are guiding you towards one.

- Examples of a correct problem statements:
  - How might we help Pierre (or your persona) measure and prepare his hydration before a race?
  - How might we make sure Pierre doesn’t get dehydrated?
  - How might we make sure Pierre drinks the cups that are offered during the race?
  - How might we provide Pierre some drink that contains everything he needs to avoid dehydration?
  - How might we make sure Pierre doesn’t get drunk the night before the race?

- Examples of wrong problem statements:
  - How might we make sure Pierre doesn’t get dehydrated?
    - Too broad —> The problem statement is out of the scope of running, so the solutions cannot be integrated in the specific context of running.
  - How might we make sure Pierre drinks the cups that are offered during the race?
    - Too narrow —> There are plenty of options to avoid dehydration without drinking the cups that are offered during the race.
  - How might we provide Pierre with a drink that contains everything he needs to avoid dehydration?
    - Focused on the solution, not the problem —> The problem statement is supposed to rephrase the brief and take into account the insights from the previous phase.
  - How might make sure Pierre doesn’t get drunk the night before the race?
    - Out of scope —> This is not about dehydration, nor about running.
- Pay attention to the global aspect of the document. It must be clear, simple and easy to read. You can get inspiration on [canva](https://www.canva.com/) but don’t overload your design with too much details!
