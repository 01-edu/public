Run

- What sports do you practice?
  - Running, sailing, kiteboarding. But sailing and kiteboarding are not very often. I haven't done any sailing or kiteboarding in over a year. In San Francisco it was different. I lived there for 6 years, and I moved to Lisbon 2 years ago.
- How often do you run?
  - When it comes to running, I go once or twice a week.
- When was the last time you went out for a run?
  - Last Thursday so 7 days ago. And the Tuesday before.

Races

- What was the last race you ran?
  - Thanksgiving 10K last year in Ohio. I had arrived 5 days before in the US.
- How was it? Tell me about the experience you had.
  - Painful. I was out of shape and jetlagged. I didn't run frequently enough for the race. And I ran so fast. But I managed to finish.
- How did you get prepared?
  - Normal running once or twice a week. Mostly alone. Occasionally people would run with me. But I went to the race with my brother-in-law.
- What would you have done differently? Why?
  - It was a race for enjoyment and not pure competition. When I was young I raced competitively.

Hydration

- What do you remember about the way you hydrated?
  - I don't hydrate a lot before the race because the water hurts my stomach. I drink a little a few hours before but not immediately before.
- How did you manage your hydration?
  - For a race, I just make sure I don't go to race dehydrated, access from my normal day-to-day.
  - I run between 5 and 10 kilometers. I'll be thirsty after the run. It's poorly managed. I'm really dehydrated. I run to get cured of my hangover and to help me think, it's very helpful. It's very much meditation for me. That's 90% of my joy of running. And I don't listen to music because it's distracting for me.
- Have you ever found yourself in trouble due to hydration? What happened?
  - Yes. There have been times in life, on run, on a bicycle ran; my thoughts were less clear, you can feel it in your muscles. Your thought slows down, your body slows down also. It becomes very hard and your sweat changes. I remember riding a bike in a cascade mountain. I started to wobble on my bike. I stopped to eat some candy, drink, lay down for 30 minutes, and go back.
- What would you never do again? Why?
  - Going on a backpacking trip without accessible water. If you have some time to contain your drink that's helpful.
