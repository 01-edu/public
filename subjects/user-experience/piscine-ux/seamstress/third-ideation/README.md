## Third Ideation

### Instructions

Run at least one of the Ideation techniques in the design process.

### Deliverables

- A PDF document with the script of the tool context.
- Completed tool: a board with all the ideas - on paper or digitally on Miro or Figma.
- A PDF document with the key learnings from this phase.

Don't forget to:

- Upload the documents on Github, in a zip folder named “ProjectTitle_Name_FirstName”, with all project deliverables as follows: “Name_FirstName_DeliverableName_Date_VersionNumber”. For example, the first deliverable can be named as “Doe_John_MidFiPrototype_05242024_V1”.
- Add a title within all written documents.

**Tips:**

- Use as many tools as needed, and make sure you do all the process in 4 working days!
- Pay attention to the global aspect of the deliverables. They must be clear, simple and easy to read. You can get inspiration [canva](https://www.canva.com/) but don’t overload your design with too much details!
