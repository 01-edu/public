## Second test protocol

### Instructions

Prepare a testing protocol and run it!

Recommended steps:

- Define the scope of the test.
- Recruit 5 users.
- Identify objectives: What are you proving?
- Establish metrics: How are you proving your design is efficient?
- Describe the steps and the instructions.
- Write an introduction to greet their user.
- Write a conclusion to thank the user.

### Deliverables

- A testing protocol script.
- Photos from the tests.
- A PDF file with the key learnings from the tests (5 tests are required) and from this phase.
- In the same PDF file you need to place at least 3 learnings or iteration suggestions to be made for the next version.

Don't forget to:

- Upload the documents on Github, in a zip folder named “ProjectTitle_Name_FirstName”, with all project deliverables as follows: “Name_FirstName_DeliverableName_Date_VersionNumber”. For example, the first deliverable can be named as “Doe_John_MidFiPrototype_05242024_V1”.
- Add a title within all written documents.

**Tips:**

- Pay attention to the global aspect of the deliverables. They must be clear, simple and easy to read. You can get inspiration [canva](https://www.canva.com/) but don’t overload your design with too much details!
