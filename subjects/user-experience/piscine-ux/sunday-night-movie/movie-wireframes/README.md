## Movie wireframes

### Instructions

Based on the 3 user flows, design 3 series of wireframes.

### Deliverables

- 3 series of wireframes (6 to 12 screens per flow) on Figma.

Don't forget to:

- Upload the documents on Github, in a zip folder named “ProjectTitle_Name_FirstName”, with all project deliverables as follows: “Name_FirstName_DeliverableName_Date_VersionNumber”. For example, the first deliverable can be named as “Doe_John_MidFiPrototype_05242024_V1”.

**Tips:**

- Drawing paper prototypes before going digital might save you some time.
- Pay attention to the global aspect of the deliverables. They must be clear, simple and easy to read. You can get inspiration [canva](https://www.canva.com/) but don’t overload your design with too much details!

  - Low-Fidelity: Paper Prototypes - [Example here](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*5nUfqqA2gjdAYHagjbHA5w.jpeg).
  - Mid-Fidelity: Wireframes - black and white, only the main elements, on digital prototype tools - [Example here](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*eGSfaxwYbxUFomYbyO6GWw.png).
  - High-Fidelity: Wireframes with color, styles, graphical details, and micro-interactions - [Example here](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*Xn0HSKAvhr4TZzC9lN5udw.gif).
