## Test on features

### Instructions

Test your wireframes!

Focus on the journeys. Prepare a test protocol with your research goals (what you want to test), test it on 5 different people and write down 3 ways to improve the prototype. Do this for all your wireframes!

### Deliverables

For each of the tests:

- A PDF document with a test protocol.
- Pictures of the ongoing tests.
- A PDF document with 3 ideas to improve the prototype based on you users' feedbacks.

Don't forget to:

- Upload the documents on Github, in a zip folder named “ProjectTitle_Name_FirstName”, with all project deliverables as follows: “Name_FirstName_DeliverableName_Date_VersionNumber”. For example, the first deliverable can be named as “Doe_John_MidFiPrototype_05242024_V1”.
- Add a title within all written documents.

**Tips:**

- Pay attention to the global aspect of the deliverables. They must be clear, simple and easy to read. You can get inspiration [canva](https://www.canva.com/) but don’t overload your design with too much details!
