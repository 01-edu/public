## Iteration

### Instructions

Based on your previous tests, pick one of your 3 prototypes.

Implement the 3 ideas you wrote down as suggestions.

Run another series of test (and adapt your test protocol if necessary).

Write a report with the conclusion you made out of this iteration loop.

### Deliverables

- Pictures of the new test.
- A report with your conclusions, your impressions and your key learnings from this iteration (PDF document).
- Comparison between V1 and V2 of the prototype in the report.

Don't forget to:

- Upload the documents on Github, in a zip folder named “ProjectTitle_Name_FirstName”, with all project deliverables as follows: “Name_FirstName_DeliverableName_Date_VersionNumber”. For example, the first deliverable can be named as “Doe_John_MidFiPrototype_05242024_V1”.
- Add a title within all written documents.

**Tips:**

- This report will be handed on to the CEO. Pay attention to the details and make sure the document is clean and easy to use!
- Pay attention to the global aspect of the deliverables. They must be clear, simple and easy to read. You can get inspiration [canva](https://www.canva.com/) but don’t overload your design with too much details!
