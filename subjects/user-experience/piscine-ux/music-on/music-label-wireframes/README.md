## Music label wireframes

### Instructions

Pick a product (a record, a song or an album) from your music label website.

Based on the new taxonomy (content categorization), show the different paths a user has to take to reach the product with a series of wireframes.

**List of websites:**

- [Universal Music Latin America](https://www.universalmusica.com/)
- [Delta Records](https://deltarecords.net/)
- [Zoho Music](https://www.zohomusic.com/)
- [Luaka Bop](https://www.luakabop.com/)
- [Rimas Music](https://rimasmusic.com/)
- You can choose another one, as long as it is a South American music label.

Don't forget to:

- Upload the Figma file on Github, labeled as follows: “Name_FirstName_DeliverableName_Date_VersionNumber”. For example, it can be labeled as “Doe_John_MidFiPrototype_05242024_V1”.
- Add a title within the file.

### Deliverables

- Wireframes (6 to 12 screens) from the home page to the product page, on Figma.

**Tips:**

- Drawing a user journey first might be helpful before rushing into wireframes
- Drawing paper prototypes before going digital might save you some time.
- Several paths are encouraged
- Pay attention to the global aspect of the file. It must be clear, simple and easy to read. You can get inspiration [canva](https://www.canva.com/) but don’t overload your design with too much details!
