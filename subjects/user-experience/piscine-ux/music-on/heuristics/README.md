## Heuristics

**Context:**

A music label specialized in music from South America asks you to improve the user experience. This quest is about heuristics and content organization!

### Instructions

Conduct a heuristic analysis on **one** of these websites:

- [Universal Music Latin America](https://www.universalmusica.com/)
- [Delta Records](https://deltarecords.net/)
- [Zoho Music](https://www.zohomusic.com/)
- [Luaka Bop](https://www.luakabop.com/)
- [Rimas Music](https://rimasmusic.com/)
- You can choose another one, as long as it is a South American music label.

- Upload the document on Github, labeled as follows: “Name_FirstName_DeliverableName_Date_VersionNumber”. For example, it can be labeled as “Doe_John_MidFiPrototype_05242024_V1”.
- Add a title within the document.

### Deliverables

- A duplicated and completed checklist on a sheet document (Google Sheets, Airtable, Excel, etc.).
- [Tool : Heuristic evaluation checklist](https://drive.google.com/file/d/10KbfbNZA1oVS1sXbjjXLPPmdZ6nqVkdc/view)

**Tips:**

- Pay attention to the global aspect of the document. It must be clear, simple and easy to read. You can get inspiration [canva](https://www.canva.com/) but don’t overload your design with too much details!
