## Site map

### Instructions

Stick to the website you have chosen in the previous exercise "heuristics" and design a site map. The site map should include all the pages of the website as well as the connections and hierarchy.

**List of websites:**

- [Universal Music Latin America](https://www.universalmusica.com/)
- [Delta Records](https://deltarecords.net/)
- [Zoho Music](https://www.zohomusic.com/)
- [Luaka Bop](https://www.luakabop.com/)
- [Rimas Music](https://rimasmusic.com/)
- You can choose another one, as long as it is a South American music label.
- Upload the PDF document on Github, labeled as follows: “Name_FirstName_DeliverableName_Date_VersionNumber”. For example, it can be labeled as “Doe_John_MidFiPrototype_05242024_V1”.
- Add a title within the document.

### Deliverables

- A PDF page of the site map.

**Tips:**

- Start by drawing on paper, then pass it on to a digital tool.
- Please label your document! Title and name of the website.
- Pay attention to the global aspect of the document. It must be clear, simple and easy to read. You can get inspiration [canva](https://www.canva.com/) but don’t overload your design with too much details!
