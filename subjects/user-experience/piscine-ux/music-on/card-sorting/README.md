## Card sorting

### Instructions

In the present situation, the websites are not ideal to complete the Jobs-to-be-Done your user has in mind. So let's practice card sorting to rearrange the content of the website!

Organize a card sorting workshop with the content of the website you chose in the exercise "Heuristics".

To do so:

- Define your research goals.
- Prepare the material.
- Find participants.
- Run a card sorting workshop on 5 people.
- Suggest a new taxonomy (content organization).

Don't forget to:

- Upload the documents on Github, in a zip folder named “ProjectTitle_Name_FirstName”, with all project deliverables as follows: “Name_FirstName_DeliverableName_Date_VersionNumber”. For example, the first deliverable can be named as “Doe_John_MidFiPrototype_05242024_V1”.
- Add a title within all written documents.

**List of websites:**

- [Universal Music Latin America](https://www.universalmusica.com/)
- [Delta Records](https://deltarecords.net/)
- [Zoho Music](https://www.zohomusic.com/)
- [Luaka Bop](https://www.luakabop.com/)
- [Rimas Music](https://rimasmusic.com/)
- You can choose another one, as long as it is a South American music label.

### Deliverables

- A card sorting workshop script with the research goals (PDF document).
- Pictures of the ongoing workshop.
- A document to show the new content organization (it can be a picture of the board with sticky notes or the digital version).

**Tips:**

- Pay attention to the global aspect of the deliverables. They must be clear, simple and easy to read. You can get inspiration [canva](https://www.canva.com/) but don’t overload your design with too much details!
