## JTBD

### Instructions

Let's practice Jobs-to-be-done to be more specific about how a music label website could be improved.

Read about Jobs-to-be-Done and the psychologic dimension behind this tool.

Then, find someone (your "user") around you who likes music a lot.

Ask them about what they would do on a music label website. Ask them why, why and why to understand the emotion behind an action, and the purpose behind a simple visit on a website.

Complete the JTBD template below including the true purpose of your "user".

And remember: You are not your user!

- Upload the PDF document on Github, labeled as follows: “Name_FirstName_DeliverableName_Date_VersionNumber”. For example, it can be labeled as “Doe_John_MidFiPrototype_05242024_V1”.
- Add a title within the document.

**Deliverable:**

- A complete Jobs-to-Be-Done on a PDF document.
  - Complete this sentence and include it on the document "When **\_\_**, I want to **\_** So I can **\_**"

**Tips:**

- Pay attention to the global aspect of the document. It must be clear, simple and easy to read. You can get inspiration [canva](https://www.canva.com/) but don"t overload your design with too much details!

**Quote:**

- "When we identify user stories early in the design process, we let them dictate the design decisions. Rather than let our preconceived ideas of how the product should be or should look do it." UX Booth
- "Documenting the what and why of each element promotes organization and makes the handoff to the development team much smoother." UX Booth
- "When we buy a product, we essentially "hire" something to get a job done. If it does the job well, when we are confronted with the same job, we hire that same product again. And if the product does a crummy job, we "fire" it and look around for something else we might hire to solve the problem." Clayton M Christensen
