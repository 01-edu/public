## Test protocol

### Instructions

Prepare a protocol for usability testing.

Recommended steps:

- Define the scope of the test.
- Recruit 5 users.
- Identify objectives: What are you proving?
- Establish metrics: How are you proving your design is efficient?
- Describe the steps and the instructions.
- Write an introduction to greet their user.
- Write a conclusion to thank the user.

Don't forget to:

- Upload the PDF document on Github, labeled as follows: “Name_FirstName_DeliverableName_Date_VersionNumber”. For example, it can be labeled as “Doe_John_MidFiPrototype_05242024_V1”.
- Add a title within the document.

**Deliverable:**

- A PDF document with a test protocol.

**Tips:**

- Pay attention to the global aspect of the document. It must be clear, simple and easy to read. You can get inspiration [canva](https://www.canva.com/) but don’t overload your design with too much details!

**Quote:**

- You need to detect: How many errors do users make? How severe are these errors? How easily can they recover from the errors?
