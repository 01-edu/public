## Heuristics

**Context:**

A music label specialized in music from South America asks you to improve the user experience. This quest is about heuristics and content organization!

### Instructions

Conduct a heuristic analysis on **one** of these websites:

- [Universal Music Latin America](https://www.universalmusica.com/)
- [Delta Records](https://deltarecords.net/)
- [Zoho Music](https://www.zohomusic.com/)
- [Luaka Bop](https://www.luakabop.com/)
- [Rimas Music](https://rimasmusic.com/)
- You can choose another one, as long as it is a South American music label.

- Upload the document on Github, labeled as follows: “Name_FirstName_DeliverableName_Date_VersionNumber”. For example, it can be labeled as “Doe_John_MidFiPrototype_05242024_V1”.
- Add a title within the document.

### Deliverables

- A duplicated and completed checklist on a sheet document (Google Sheets, Airtable, Excel, etc.).
- [Tool : Heuristic evaluation checklist](https://drive.google.com/file/d/10KbfbNZA1oVS1sXbjjXLPPmdZ6nqVkdc/view)

**Tips:**

- Pay attention to the global aspect of the documents. It must be clear, simple and easy to read. You can get inspiration [canva](https://www.canva.com/) but don’t overload your design with too much details!

## JTBD

### Instructions

Let's practice Jobs-to-be-done to be more specific about how a music label website could be improved.

Read about Jobs-to-be-Done and the psychologic dimension behind this tool.

Then, find someone (your "user") around you who likes music a lot.

Ask them about what they would do on a music label website. Ask them why, why and why to understand the emotion behind an action, and the purpose behind a simple visit on a website.

Complete the JTBD template below including the true purpose of your "user".

And remember: You are not your user!

- Upload the PDF document on Github, labeled as follows: “Name_FirstName_DeliverableName_Date_VersionNumber”. For example, it can be labeled as “Doe_John_MidFiPrototype_05242024_V1”.
- Add a title within the document.

**Deliverable:**

- A complete Jobs-to-Be-Done on a PDF document.
  - Complete this sentence and include it on the document "When **\_\_**, I want to **\_** So I can **\_**"

**Tips:**

- Pay attention to the global aspect of the document. It must be clear, simple and easy to read. You can get inspiration [canva](https://www.canva.com/) but don"t overload your design with too much details!

**Quote:**

- "When we identify user stories early in the design process, we let them dictate the design decisions. Rather than let our preconceived ideas of how the product should be or should look do it." UX Booth
- "Documenting the what and why of each element promotes organization and makes the handoff to the development team much smoother." UX Booth
- "When we buy a product, we essentially "hire" something to get a job done. If it does the job well, when we are confronted with the same job, we hire that same product again. And if the product does a crummy job, we "fire" it and look around for something else we might hire to solve the problem." Clayton M Christensen

## Card sorting

### Instructions

In the present situation, the websites are not ideal to complete the Jobs-to-be-Done your user has in mind. So let's practice card sorting to rearrange the content of the website!

Organize a card sorting workshop with the content of the website you chose in the exercise "Heuristics".

To do so:

- Define your research goals.
- Prepare the material.
- Find participants.
- Run a card sorting workshop on 5 people.
- Suggest a new taxonomy (content organization).

Don't forget to:

- Upload the documents on Github, in a zip folder named “ProjectTitle_Name_FirstName”, with all project deliverables as follows: “Name_FirstName_DeliverableName_Date_VersionNumber”. For example, the first deliverable can be named as “Doe_John_MidFiPrototype_05242024_V1”.
- Add a title within all written documents.

**List of websites:**

- [Universal Music Latin America](https://www.universalmusica.com/)
- [Delta Records](https://deltarecords.net/)
- [Zoho Music](https://www.zohomusic.com/)
- [Luaka Bop](https://www.luakabop.com/)
- [Rimas Music](https://rimasmusic.com/)
- You can choose another one, as long as it is a South American music label.

### Deliverables

- A card sorting workshop script with the research goals (PDF document).
- Pictures of the ongoing workshop.
- A document to show the new content organization (it can be a picture of the board with sticky notes or the digital version).

**Tips:**

- Pay attention to the global aspect of the deliverables. They must be clear, simple and easy to read. You can get inspiration [canva](https://www.canva.com/) but don’t overload your design with too much details!

## Music label wireframes

### Instructions

Pick a product (a record, a song or an album) from your music label website.

Based on the new taxonomy (content categorization), show the different paths a user has to take to reach the product with a series of wireframes.

**List of websites:**

- [Universal Music Latin America](https://www.universalmusica.com/)
- [Delta Records](https://deltarecords.net/)
- [Zoho Music](https://www.zohomusic.com/)
- [Luaka Bop](https://www.luakabop.com/)
- [Rimas Music](https://rimasmusic.com/)
- You can choose another one, as long as it is a South American music label.

Don't forget to:

- Upload the Figma file on Github, labeled as follows: “Name_FirstName_DeliverableName_Date_VersionNumber”. For example, it can be labeled as “Doe_John_MidFiPrototype_05242024_V1”.
- Add a title within the file.

### Deliverables

- Wireframes (6 to 12 screens) from the home page to the product page, on Figma.

**Tips:**

- Drawing a user journey first might be helpful before rushing into wireframes
- Drawing paper prototypes before going digital might save you some time.
- Several paths are encouraged
- Pay attention to the global aspect of the file. It must be clear, simple and easy to read. You can get inspiration [canva](https://www.canva.com/) but don’t overload your design with too much details!
