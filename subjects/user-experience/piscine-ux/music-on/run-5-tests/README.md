## Run 5 tests

### Instructions

Run the test on 5 people!

Don't forget to:

- Upload the documents on Github, in a zip folder named “ProjectTitle_Name_FirstName”, with all project deliverables as follows: “Name_FirstName_DeliverableName_Date_VersionNumber”. For example, the first deliverable can be named as “Doe_John_MidFiPrototype_05242024_V1”.
- Add a title within all written documents.

### Deliverables

- Pictures of the ongoing test.
- A PDF document with the conclusions from each test and 3 major ideas to improve the prototype.

**Tips:**

- Pay attention to the global aspect of the deliverables. They must be clear, simple and easy to read. You can get inspiration [canva](https://www.canva.com/) but don’t overload your design with too much details!

**Quote:**

- To get trustworthy results in your test, you can’t ask your customers to use their imagination. You’ve got to show them something realistic. If you do, their reactions will be genuine.
