## Second User Journey

### Instructions

Now you have your persona, it's time to set it in motion.

Design a User Journey to represent your persona in their environment across the time, with key steps or actions related to our current topic (harassment).

The timeline can be of a day, a few hours, or a week. Please include the key moments related to harassment alongside the emotions related to each step. Use the material from your interviews and surveys.

Then, highlight the main pain points that need to be solved.

- Upload the Figma file on Github, labeled as follows: “Name_FirstName_DeliverableName_Date_VersionNumber”. For example, it can be labeled as “Doe_John_MidFiPrototype_05242024_V1”.
- Add a title within the file.

**Deliverable:**

- A Figma document with your persona's user journey.

**Tips:**

- Pay attention to the global aspect of the file. It must be clear, simple and easy to read. You can get inspiration [canva](https://www.canva.com/) but don’t overload your design with too much details!

**Resources:**

Most articles you'll find will be about user journeys or customer journeys. Keep in mind that you can adapt this methodology to any persona with any kind of situation or process, even at school, outside the school, in the digital world, etc.
