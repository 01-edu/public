## Broadcast strategy

### Instructions

Define and run your broadcast strategy among teenagers (15-18 years old)

Even though a proper survey requires at least 100 answers, for this exercise we request you to get 40.

Don't forget to:

- Upload the documents on Github, in a zip folder named “ProjectTitle_Name_FirstName”, with all project deliverables as follows: “Name_FirstName_DeliverableName_Date_VersionNumber”. For example, the first deliverable can be named as “Doe_John_MidFiPrototype_05242024_V1”.
- Add a title within all written documents.

### Deliverables

- A PDF document gathering your strategy.
Please include:
  - Who you are targeting (remember, you can focus on your hometown as well as the whole planet)
  - A few ideas about how to reach them.
  - The channels you intend to use - be specific and include the links to the groups, forums, pages, account you plan to reach.(at least 8 different channels)
  - At least 2 different messages.
  - A plan A, B and C.
  - the 40 answers or more.
- A document to express your main feedback after running your broadcast strategy: what worked best? have you encountered any difficulties? What were they? How did you overcome them?

**Tips:**

In order to do so, you need to be creative and strategic!

- Who are you targeting? Teenagers, bullies, persecutor, witnesses, parents, teachers, people in the administration? From where?
- How can you reach them? Through which channels? On which forums, groups, with which hashtags? Will you try to get them through influencers?
- What words and what tone will you use?
- How will you approach them? What message will you write?
- What have you planned if they don't answer right away?
- Pay attention to the global aspect of the deliverables. They must be clear, simple and easy to read. You can get inspiration [canva](https://www.canva.com/) but don’t overload your design with too much details!

Once your strategy is prepared, run it!
