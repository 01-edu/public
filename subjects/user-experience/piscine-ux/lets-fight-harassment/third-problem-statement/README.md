## Third problem statement

### Instructions

Based on your previous work, your persona and your user journey's main pain point, define a problem statement that would clarify the main problem you want to tackle.
You may use the "How Might We" exercise in pairs.

Then, define 3 KPIs (Key performance Indicators) that will help you measure the definition of Done and the success of the solution.

- Upload the PDF document on Github, labeled as follows: “Name_FirstName_DeliverableName_Date_VersionNumber”. For example, it can be labeled as “Doe_John_MidFiPrototype_05242024_V1”.
- Add a title within the document.

### Deliverables

- A PDF document with one problem statement and 3 KPIs to measure the impact of the solution

**Tips:**

- Pay attention to the global aspect of the document. It must be clear, simple and easy to read. You can get inspiration [canva](https://www.canva.com/) but don’t overload your design with too much details!
