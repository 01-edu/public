## Second Personas

### Instructions

Let's create a persona based on your quantitative research and your interviews.

Your persona card should include common trends amongst the people you got data from (habits, verbatims, fears, drivers, frustration, and pain points).

- Upload the PDF document on Github, labeled as follows: “Name_FirstName_DeliverableName_Date_VersionNumber”. For example, it can be labeled as “Doe_John_MidFiPrototype_05242024_V1”.
- Add a title within the document.

**Reminder:** Your persona is fictional and should not have the exact name or picture as someone you interviewed, but remember a persona is here so you can make decisions as a designer.

### Deliverables

- A PDF persona card extracted from a Figma file.

**Tips:**

- Pay attention to the global aspect of the document. It must be clear, simple and easy to read. You can get inspiration [canva](https://www.canva.com/) but don’t overload your design with too much details!
