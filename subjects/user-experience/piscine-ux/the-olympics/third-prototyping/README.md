## Third Prototyping

### Instructions

Give another dimension to your user flow and turn your user flow into a paper prototype (6 to 12 screens max).

First, draw low-fidelity prototypes on paper. One main screen = 1 mobile frame.

Then, draw your mid-fidelity screens on Figma with simple shapes, in black and white.

Don't forget to:

- Upload the documents on Github, in a zip folder named “ProjectTitle_Name_FirstName”, with all project deliverables as follows: “Name_FirstName_DeliverableName_Date_VersionNumber”. For example, the first deliverable can be named as “Doe_John_MidFiPrototype_05242024_V1”.
- Add a title within all written documents.

### Deliverables

- Picture of a paper prototype.
- A Figma file with the wireframes (mid-fi).

**Tips:**

- Low-Fidelity: Paper Prototypes - [Example here](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*5nUfqqA2gjdAYHagjbHA5w.jpeg)
- Mid-Fidelity: Wireframes - black and white, only the main elements, on digital prototype tools - [Example here](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*eGSfaxwYbxUFomYbyO6GWw.png)
- High-Fidelity: Wireframes with color, styles, graphical details, and micro-interactions - [Example here](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*Xn0HSKAvhr4TZzC9lN5udw.gif)
- Pay attention to the global aspect of the document. It must be clear, simple and easy to read. You can get inspiration [canva](https://www.canva.com/) but don’t overload your design with too much details!

**Quotes:**

- "If you’re not embarrassed by the first version of your product, you’ve launched too late’ Reid Hoffman | LinkedIn
- "To prototype your solution, you’ll need a temporary change of philosophy: from perfect to just enough, from long-term quality to temporary simulation."
- "The prototype is meant to answer questions, so keep it focused. You just need a real-looking facade to which customers can react."
