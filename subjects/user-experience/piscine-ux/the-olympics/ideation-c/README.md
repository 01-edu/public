## Ideation C

### Instructions

Let's be creative!

Organize and run an ideation workshop with 4 to 8 participants to find ideas to solve this problem statement:

**How might we help sports fans organize local Olympic Games in between 2 international editions?**

C is leader, A is time-keeper and B focuses on logistics.

- The ideation workshop script should include:

  - The main objective.
  - An ice breaker.
  - The main steps of the ideation process.
  - Clear instructions.
  - A time schedule for each step.
  - A voting process to select the main idea.

Don't forget to:

- Upload the documents on Github, in a zip folder named “ProjectTitle_Name_FirstName”, with all project deliverables as follows: “Name_FirstName_DeliverableName_Date_VersionNumber”. For example, the first deliverable can be named as “Doe_John_MidFiPrototype_05242024_V1”.
- Add a title within all written documents.

Pay attention not to use the same ideation technique as in Ex 2!

### Deliverables

- A PDF document with the ideation workshop script.
- Pictures of the ongoing workshop.
- A PDF document that represents the main concept out of the workshop.

**Tips:**

- Pay attention to the global aspect of the deliverables. They must be clear, simple and easy to read. You can get inspiration [canva](https://www.canva.com/) but don’t overload your design with too much details!
