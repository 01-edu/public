## Ideation A

**Context:**

The Olympics committee calls on you to get fresh ideas for the next Olympic Games.

You’ll team up by groups of 3 and focus each on one problem statement.

You’ll get guidelines and suggestions to run ideation workshops, and bring your ideas to life with three different prototypes, that you will animate and test.

### Instructions

Let's be creative!

Organize and run an ideation workshop with 4 to 8 participants to find ideas to solve this problem statement:

**How might we create a digital sport anyone (including athletes, non-athletes, disabled) could play between now and the next Olympics edition?**

A is leader, B is time-keeper and C focuses on logistics.

- The ideation workshop script should include:

  - The main objective.
  - An ice breaker.
  - The main steps of the ideation process.
  - Clear instructions.
  - A time schedule for each step.
  - A voting process to select the main idea.

Don't forget to:

- Upload the documents on Github, in a zip folder named “ProjectTitle_Name_FirstName”, with all project deliverables as follows: “Name_FirstName_DeliverableName_Date_VersionNumber”. For example, the first deliverable can be named as “Doe_John_MidFiPrototype_05242024_V1”.
- Add a title within all written documents.

### Deliverables

- A PDF document with the ideation workshop script.
- Pictures of the ongoing workshop.
- A PDF document that represents the main concept out of the workshop.

**Tips:**

- Pay attention to the global aspect of the deliverables. They must be clear, simple and easy to read. You can get inspiration [canva](https://www.canva.com/) but don’t overload your design with too much details!
