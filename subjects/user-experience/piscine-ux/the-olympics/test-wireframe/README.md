## Test Wireframe

### Instructions

Test your wireframe prototype with 5 different people and write down the 5 main iterations that need to be made on the next version.

This exercise is to be made individually.

Don't forget to:

- Upload the documents on Github, in a zip folder named “ProjectTitle_Name_FirstName”, with all project deliverables as follows: “Name_FirstName_DeliverableName_Date_VersionNumber”. For example, the first deliverable can be named as “Doe_John_MidFiPrototype_05242024_V1”.
- Add a title within all written documents.

### Deliverables

- A PDF document with the usability test script that includes:
    - A greeting and onboarding paragraph.
    - A scenario the user has to complete.
    - A conclusion to wrap up the test and thank the user.
- Pictures of the ongoing tests.
- A PDF document with a report on what you learnt and a list of the 5 main iterations that you'd like to do on the next version.

**Tips:**

- Pay attention to the global aspect of the deliverables. They must be clear, simple and easy to read. You can get inspiration [canva](https://www.canva.com/) but don’t overload your design with too much details!

**Quote:**

Prototypes are created for testing purposes, that’s why creating a prototype without running tests on it makes no sense.
