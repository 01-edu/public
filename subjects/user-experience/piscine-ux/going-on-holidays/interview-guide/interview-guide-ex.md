**Introduction**

Hello! My name is Jasmin and I am conducting user research about how mums organize a trip when they are going on holidays with their family. Hence I'd love to know more about your experience in that kind of situation. Can I have 15 minutes of your time for a chat?

**Screening questions:**

- How old are you?
- Where do you live?
- What do you do for a living?

**Topic 1: Tasks distribution upfront**

- When was the last time you went on holiday with your family?
- Who organized what before the stay (location, transportation, food shopping)?
- How easy was it? Why?

**Topic 2: Potential tensions**

- How well did the holiday go in terms of tasks management?
- Who took care of what?
- Were there any frustration due to the logistics? Why?

**Topic 3: Tools**

- What tools did you and your partner use to set up the holidays (apps, sites, canvas, etc.)?
- How helpful were they? Why?

**Topic 4: Next trip**

- What would you like to change between your last and next trip with your family?

**Conclusion**

Thank you so much for your time! This is very helpful for our research, especially on knowing what to improve to ease holiday organization management.

Would you have anyone you know who you think is quite concerned about this topic?

We/I will prepare a questionnaire for other kinds of information. Would you be kind enough to answer it when it's ready?
