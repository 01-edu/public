## Chunky

### Instructions

Create the `chunk` function which has as parameters an `array` that will be split and an `integer` which is the size that the array should be split.

The function will return an array of elements divided into groups of the length of the given size.
If the array cannot be split evenly, the final part will be the remaining elements.
