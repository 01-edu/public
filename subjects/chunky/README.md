## Chunky

### Instructions

Create a function named `chunk` which accepts an array and an integer representing a size.

Your function will chunk the array into sub-arrays, and return an array with each sub-array as its elements. The length of each sub-array is denoted by the size argument.

If the array cannot be split evenly, the last sub-array will contain the remaining elements.
