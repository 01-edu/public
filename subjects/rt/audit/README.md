#### Functional

##### Using the ray tracer construct any scene you want, including at least one of all objects. (this can take a while to render, so in the meanwhile you can answer the next questions)

###### Does the image corresponds to the scene you created?

##### Move the camera and render the same scene.

###### Does the image corresponds to the same scene, but from a different perspective?

###### Did the student provided 4 .ppm pictures?

###### Does one of these images consist of a scene with a sphere?

###### Does one of these images consist of a scene with a plane and a cube with lower brightness than in the sphere image?

###### Does one of these images consist of a scene with one of each of all the objects (one cube, one sphere, one cylinder and one plane)?

###### Does one of these images consist of a scene like the previous one, but with the camera in another position (thus generating the same image from a different perspective)?

###### Considering all of the previous pictures, can you see any changes in brightness?

###### Considering all of the previous pictures, can you see shadows from the objects?

###### Did the student provided documentation for the ray tracer on how to use it (create elements, change brightness and move the camera)?

#### Bonus

###### +Is it possible to add textures to the surface of the objects?

###### +Is it possible to make reflective and/or refractive objects?

###### +Is it possible to add particles?

###### +Is it possible to add fluids?
