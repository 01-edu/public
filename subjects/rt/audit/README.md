#### Functional

##### Using the ray tracer construct any scene you want, including at least one of all objects. (this can take a while to render, so in the meantime you can skip the first two questions and answer the following ones)

###### Does the image correspond to the scene you created?

###### Is it possible for you to reduce the resolution of the output image?

##### Move the camera and render the same scene.

###### Does the image correspond to the same scene, but from a different perspective?

###### Did the student provide 4 .ppm pictures?

###### Does one of these images consist of a scene with a sphere?

###### Does one of these images consist of a scene with a flat plane and a cube with lower brightness than in the sphere image?

###### Does one of these images consist of a scene with one of each of all the objects (one cube, one sphere, one cylinder and one flat plane)?

###### Does one of these images consist of a scene like the previous one, but with the camera in another position (thus generating the same image from a different perspective)?

###### Considering all of the previous pictures, can you see shadows from the objects?

###### Did the student provide clear documentation for the ray tracer on how to use it (create elements, change brightness and move the camera)?

#### Unit Tests

###### Do all tests pass without errors?

###### Are there specific tests for **Ray-Object Intersections** (e.g., verifying that a ray correctly detects hitting a sphere or a cylinder)?

###### Are there tests for **Vector Math** (e.g., ensuring dot products and normalization are calculated correctly)?

###### Are there tests for **Light and Color** logic, such as ensuring brightness changes don't cause overflow in the RGB values?

#### Bonus

###### +Is it possible to add textures to the surface of the objects?

###### +Is it possible to make reflective and/or refractive objects?

###### +Is it possible to add particles?

###### +Is it possible to add fluids?
