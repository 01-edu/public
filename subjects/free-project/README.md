## free-project

### Instructions

The free project is the opportunity to show what you have learned by making your
own webpage.

You need to submit at least one `index.html` page, have some styling in a
`style.css` file and add a a `script.js` file, all of them must be properly
linked and used.

Focus on building something that interest you, anything you want as long as you
use the given files for it:

- Interactive trivia pages of something you love
- Business oriented ? Build your own branding with your online CV
- Artistic soul ? Make your own generative art
- You have a story to tell ? Make a point and click adventure
- Looking for a fun but ambitious idea ? Try a basic game (lots of JS)

**Don't hesitate to use the code from the previous raid to get a head start.**

> Not inspired ? Just focus on improving your previous raid:
>
> - Customize the colors
> - Change the subject
> - Add a new section, pictures
> - Do all the bonuses
> - Make sections collapsable
