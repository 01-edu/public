#### Functiona

##### Try and run the application.

###### Can you see the cross intersection?

###### If so is there any image/asset that represents this intersection?

##### Try and run the application, then generate a vehicle at your choice.

###### Is there any animation for the vehicle?

##### Try and run the application, then generate a vehicle that turns right.

###### Did the vehicle animate when turning right?

##### Try and run the application, then generate a vehicle by pressing the `"Arrow Up"` key.

###### Was a vehicle generated from the cardinal south?

##### Try pressing the `"Arrow Down"` key.

###### Was a vehicle generated from the cardinal North?

##### Try pressing the `"Arrow Right"` key.

###### Was a vehicle generated from the cardinal west?

##### Try pressing the `"Arrow left"` key.

###### Was a vehicle generated from the cardinal east?

##### Try pressing the `"R"` key.

###### Are vehicles generated randomly(random lane and route)?

##### Try to generate tree vehicles in the same lane (do this to all lanes).

###### Did all vehicles passed the intersection without any collision?

##### Try to generate four vehicles at the same time, one using the `"Right"` key and the other using the `"Left"` key (to this until there is a collision route).

###### Did all vehicles passed the intersection without any collision?

##### Try to generate four vehicles at the same time, one using the `"Up"` key and the other using the `"Left"` key (to this until there is a collision route).

###### Did all vehicles passed the intersection without any collision?

##### Try to generate four vehicles at the same time, one using the `"Up"` key and the other using the `"Right"` key (to this until there is a collision route).

###### Did all vehicles passed the intersection without any collision?

##### Try to generate four vehicles at the same time, one using the `"Down"` key and the other using the `"Left"` key (to this until there is a collision route).

###### Did all vehicles passed the intersection without any collision?

##### Try to generate four vehicles at the same time, one using the `"Down"` key and the other using the `"Right"` key (to this until there is a collision route).

###### Did all vehicles passed the intersection without any collision?

##### Try to generate five vehicles using the `"Up"` key, at the same time generate two vehicles using the key `"Right"`.

###### Did all vehicles passed the intersection without any collision?

##### Try to generate three vehicles that are supposed to collide (vehicles in the collision lane) fo this at least 3 times.

###### Did one of the vehicles tried to avoid the collision, by reducing their velocity?

##### Try to generate vehicles randomly using the `"R"` key. Then wait for at least 1 min.

###### Did all vehicles passed the intersection without any collision?

###### Was there a low traffic congestion while running the application? (ex: high traffic congestion can be 8 or more vehicles in the same lane without proceeding)?

##### Try to generate four vehicles using the `"UP"` key to generate two and the `"Right"` key to generate the other two. Then when the vehicles finish passing the intersection, exit the application by using the `"Esc"` key.

###### Did the application displayed a window with statistics of the simulation?

###### And if so did it display the "Max number of vehicles that passed the intersection" as 4?

###### Did it also displayed the "Collisions" as 0?

###### Did it also displayed the "Max velocity" and the "Min velocity"?

###### Did it also displayed the "Max time that took the vehicle to pass the intersection"?

###### Did it also displayed the "Min time that took the vehicle to pass the intersection"?

###### Did it also displayed the "Close calls", if there were any?

#### General

###### Is it not possible to spam the creation of vehicles(by pressing the arrow keys to many times)?

###### Are vehicles assigned to their own route, and if so do they obey that route? (you can use the lanes to see if its obeyed)

###### Are vehicles kept in a safe distance(do not collide when ever one stops or reduces their velocity)?

###### Do vehicles present at least 3 different velocities?

#### Bonus

###### +Does the application present more statistics beside the ones stated in the subject?

###### +Did the student create their own assets?

###### +Is this algorithm a good implementation for real life situations?
