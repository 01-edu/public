#### Functional

###### Does animation run using `RequestAnimationFrame`?

###### Does the game avoid the use of frameworks?

###### Does the game have at least 3 tile maps?

###### Are the maps available different from each other?

###### Does the game generate different tile maps, not making use of tile editors?

##### Try playing the game in 3 different maps.

###### Were you able to play the game with no inconvenience?

###### Does the game avoid the use of `canvas`?

##### Check the tile map in the code and the map on the game.

###### Does the tile map in the code matches with the displayed map?

###### Is the tile map in the code [well structured](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Games/Techniques/Tilemaps#The_tilemap_data_structure)?

##### Try using the Dev Tool/Performance.

###### Can you confirm that there are no frame drops?

##### Try using the Dev Tool/Performance

###### Does the game run at/or around 60fps? (from 50 to 60 or more)

##### Try using the Dev Tool/performance and the option rendering with the paint ON, if possible.

###### Can you confirm that the paint is being used as little as possible?

##### Try using the Dev Tool/performance and the option rendering with the layer ON, if possible.

###### Can you confirm that the layers are being used as little as possible?

###### Is [layer creation being promoted](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/performance/rendering/stick-to-compositor-only-properties-and-manage-layer-count) properly?

#### Bonus

###### +Does the project run quickly and effectively? (Favoring recursivity, no unnecessary data requests, etc...)

###### +Does the code obey the [good practices](../../good-practices/README.md)?

###### +Is the code using asynchronicity to increase performance?

###### +Do you think this project is well done in general?
