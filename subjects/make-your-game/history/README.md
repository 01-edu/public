## history

### Objectives

You must follow the same [principles](../README.md) as in the first subject.

For this project you must create a **story mode**, a mode in a computer game in which the player plays through a story.

Take for instance **Super Mario** where a story is being told in which the main character tries to save the princess.
With some creativity even [Brick Breaker/ Arkanoid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arkanoid) can be done with a story mode.

### Instructions

A story must have some kind of logic and evolution, you must not simply write something on a board and it is done, no!

The story must have at least:

- an introduction, the context and beginning of the story (should be shown before starting the game)
- a development, the story reaches a waypoint (should be shown when you hit a specific score while playing)
- a conclusion, the end of the story (should be shown when the game ends, either with a loss or a victory)

This project will help you learn about:

- Game story mode
