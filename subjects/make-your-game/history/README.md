## history

### Objectives

You must follow the same [principles](https://public.01-edu.org/subjects/make-your-game/README.md) as the first subject.

For this project you must take into account the creation of a **story mode**, a version of a computer game in which the player controls a character in a story.

Take for instance **Super Mario** where the main character is the player and you must save the princess and during the game play there is a story being told.
Even [Brick Breaker/ Arkanoid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arkanoid) can be done with a story mode.

### Instructions

A story must have some kind of logic, you must not simply write something on a board and its done, no!

It must have:

- an introduction, the context and beginning of the story (should be shown before starting playing)
- a development, the story reaches a middle (should be shown when you hit a specific score while playing)
- a conclusion, the end of the story (should be shown when the game ends, either you lose or win)

This project will help you learn about:

- Game story mode
