## GraphQL

### Objectives

The objective of this project is to learn the query language [graphQL](https://graphql.org/) by creating your own profile page. It will be provided,\
by the platform, a graphQL endpoint that is connected to the database. So you can query this endpoint to obtain the information you desire.\
**Note** that for security reasons some tables are private and some are public, you will only be provided with certain content.

Your profile must have at least 3 sections of content at your choice, for example:

- Basic user identification
- XP amount
- level
- grades
- audits
- skills

Beside those sections it will have a mandatory section for the generation of statistic graphs.

### Instructions

You will have to create a profile UI where you can see your own school information. This information/data is present on the graphQL endpoint, where you will have to query it.

For the UI it will be up to you to design it. But have in mind the principles of a [good UI](https://public.01-edu.org/subjects/good-practices/).\
The UI will have a statistic section where you can generate graphs to see more about your journey and achievements on the school. This graphs must be done using [SVG](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG). You will have to do at least **two different statistic graphs** for the data given.

Using SVG you can create several [types of graphs](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/svg/graph.htm) including interactive graphs and animated graph. It will be up to you to decide what type of graphs you are going to do.

Here are some possible combinations for the creation of the graphs:

- XP earned in a time period (progress over time)
- Levels over time
- XP earned by project
- Audit ratio
- Projects `PASS` and `FAIL` ratio
- Piscine (JS/Go) stats
  - `PASS` and `FAIL` ratio
  - Attempts for each exercise

Any other information you desire to display is welcome and will be noted.

### Hosting

Besides the creation of your own profile you will have to host it! There are several places where you can host your profile,\
for example: [github-pages](https://pages.github.com/), [netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) and so on. You are free to choose the hosting place.

### Usage

> To test your queries you can access the GraphQL IDE on _https://[[DOMAIN]]/public/subjects/graphql/_ or create your own [**GraphiQL Docs**](https://github.com/graphql/graphiql). This will give you a bigger picture of the tables, attributes and all the types of queries that you can do.

Here are the list of tables that you are allowed to query (it will be only provided the columns present on the tables):

- **User table**:

  This table will have information about the user

  | id  |   login |
  | --- | ------: |
  | 1   | person1 |
  | 2   | person2 |
  | 3   | person3 |

- **Transactions table**:

  This table will give you access to XP and audits ratio

  | id  | type | amount | objectId | userId |
  | --- | :--: | -----: | -------: | -----: |
  | 1   |  xp  |    234 |       42 |      1 |
  | 2   |  xp  |   1700 |        2 |      2 |
  | 3   |  xp  |    175 |       64 |      3 |

- **Progress_view table**:

  | id  | userId | objectId | grade |
  | --- | :----: | -------: | ----: |
  | 1   |   1    |     3001 |     1 |
  | 2   |   2    |      198 |     0 |
  | 3   |   3    |      177 |     1 |

- **Results table**:

  Both progress and result table will give you the student progression

  | id  | objectId | userId | grade | progressId | type |
  | --- | -------: | -----: | ----: | ---------: | ---: |
  | 1   |        3 |      1 |     0 |         58 |      |
  | 2   |       23 |      1 |     0 |         58 |      |
  | 3   |       41 |      6 |     1 |         58 |      |

- **Object table**:

  This table will give you information about all objects (exercises/projects)

  | id  | name |     type |                     attrs | childrenAttrs |
  | --- | ---: | -------: | ------------------------: | ------------: |
  | 1   |    0 | exercise | `{"language": "dom", ...` |          `{}` |
  | 2   |    0 |  project |  `{"language": "go", ...` |          `{}` |
  | 3   |    1 | exercise |  `{"language": "js", ...` |          `{}` |

Examples:

Lets take for instance the table `user` and try to query it:

```js
{
  query {
      user {
          id
      }
  }
}
```

This simple query will return an array with the `id`s of the users. Imagine if you wanted the `login`,\
you could just add this attribute to the query, example:

```js
{
  query {
      user {
          id
          login
      }
  }
}
```

You can try to `curl` the API endpoint to see the result given by the server:

- `curl "https://[[DOMANIN]]/api/graphql-engine/v1/graphql" --data '{"query":"{user{id login}}"}'`

Here is another example of a query using the table `user`:

```js
{
  query {
    user(where: { id: { _eq: 6 }}) {
      id
      login
    }
  }
}
```

**Note** that for this query is required the introduction of variables (arguments)\
 so it will return just one user, the user that has the `id` equal to `6`.

You can see the result using `curl`:

- `curl "https://[[DOMANIN]]/api/graphql-engine/v1/graphql" --data '{"query":"{user(where:{id:{_eq:6}}){id login}}"}'`

In graphQL the usage of arguments can be specified in the schema of the API. Like said above you can visit the _docs_ for the graphQL endpoint, _https://[[DOMAIN]]/public/subjects/grapqhl_

Example of nesting, using the result and user table :

```js
{
  result {
    id
    user {
      id
      login
    }
  }
}
```

For this example we ask for the results `id` and `user`s that are associated to the `result`, requesting the users `login`s and `id`s.

**You must use all the types of querying present above** (_normal_, _nested_ and using _arguments_), do not forget that you can use the types together or separately.
