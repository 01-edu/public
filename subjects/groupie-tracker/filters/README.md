## groupie-tracker-filters

### Objectives

You must follow the same [principles](https://public.01-edu.org/subjects/groupie-tracker/) as the first subject.

- Groupie Tracker Filters consists on letting the user filter the artists/bands that will be shown.

- Your project must incorporate at least these four filters:

  - filter by creation date
  - filter by first album date
  - filter by number of members
  - filter by locations of concerts

- You must use at least these two types of filters:
  - a range filter
  - a check box filter

This project will help you learn about:

- Manipulation, display and storage of data
- Event creation and display
- JSON files and format
- Go routines

### Hints

- You have to pay attention to the locations. For example Seattle, Washington, USA **is part of** Washington, USA.

### Instructions

- The backend must be written in **Go**.
- You must handle website errors.
- The code must respect the [good practices](https://public.01-edu.org/subjects/good-practices/)
- It is recommended that the code should present a **test file**.

### Allowed packages

- Only the [standard go](https://golang.org/pkg/) packages are allowed
