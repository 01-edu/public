## groupietrackers

### Objectives

Groupie Trackers consists on receiving a given API and manipulate the data contained in it, in order to create a site, displaying all or part of the information.

- It will ge given an [API](link_to_api), that consists of four parts:
  - The first one, `artists`, contains some information about some bands and artists like their name(s), an image, in which year they began their activity and the date of their first album.
  - The second one, `locations`, consists in their last and/or upcoming concert locations.
  - The third one, `dates`, consists in their last and/or upcoming concert dates.
  - And the last one, `relations`, does the link between all the other parts, `artists`, `dates` and `locations`.
- All data given in the API should be used.

- This project also focuses on the creation of events and on their visualization.
- An event-driven system consists in a system that responds to some kind of action triggered by the client, time, or any other factor.
- You can learn more about events [here](https://medium.com/omarelgabrys-blog/event-driven-systems-cdbe5a4b3d04).

This project will help you learn about :

- Manipulation and storage of data.
- HTML.
- Event creation and display.
- JSON files.

### Instructions

- The backend must be written in **Go**.
- The code must respect the [**good practices**](https://github.com/01-edu/public/blob/master/subjects/good-practices.en.md).
- It is recommended that the code should present a **test file**.
