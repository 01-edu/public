### Objectives

Groupie Trackers consists on receiving a given API and manipulate the data contained in it, in order to create a site, displaying all or part of the information.

- It will be given an [API](http://groupietrackers.org/api), that consists in four parts:

  - The first one, `artists`, containing information about some bands and artists like their name(s), image, in which year they began their activity and the date of their first album.

  - The second one, `locations`, consists in their last and/or upcoming concert locations.

  - The third one, `dates`, consists in their last and/or upcoming concert dates.

  - And the last one, `relations`, does the link between all the other parts, `artists`, `dates` and `locations`.

- All data given in the API should be used.

- This project also focuses on the creation of events and on their visualization.

  - An event-driven system consists in a system that responds to some kind of action triggered by the client, time, or any other factor.

This project will help you learn about :

- Manipulation and storage of data.
- HTML.
- Event creation and display.
  - [Event-driven system](https://medium.com/omarelgabrys-blog/event-driven-systems-cdbe5a4b3d04).

### Instructions

- The code must respect the [**good practices**](https://github.com/01-edu/public/blob/master/subjects/good-practices.en.md).
- It is recommended that the code should present a **test file**.
