## groupie-trackers-filters

### Objectives

You must follow the same [principles](https://github.com/01-edu/public/blob/master/subjects/groupie-trackers/groupie-trackers.en.md) as the first subject.

- Groupie Trackers Filters consists on letting the user filter the artists/bands that will be shown.

- Your project must incorporate at least these four filters:
  - filter by creation date
  - filter by first album date
  - filter by number of members
  - filter by locations of concerts

- You must use at least these two types of filters:
  - a range filter
  - a check box filter

This project will help you learn about:

- Manipulation, display and storage of data
- Event creation and display
- JSON files and format
- Go routines

### Hints

- You have to pay attention to the locations. For example Seattle, Washington, USA **is part of** Washington, USA.

### Instructions

- The backend must be written in **Go**.
- You must handle website errors.
- The code must respect the [good practices](https://github.com/01-edu/public/blob/master/subjects/good-practices.en.md)
- It is recommended that the code should present a **test file**.
