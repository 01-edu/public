## Doctor Strange

### Instructions

You have been given the mission to create a new sense of time.
Instead of a normal week having only 7 days, you will have 14 days.
Your mission is to create an `addWeek` function that can make this happen.
So now, a week is 14 days from `Monday` to `Sunday` then `secondMonday` to `secondSunday`.

Now imagine you have a doctor appointment and you have to wait some hours.
But you do not want to wait, so what you need to do is create a
function `timeTravel` that allows you to change the time according to your needs, this function
it can go backwards or forwards in time.
You will have a function that takes a date and you will pass 3 more parameters to change
the hour, minute and seconds.


### Example

```js
timeTravel({ date, hour, minute, second })

timeTravel({
  date: new Date('2020-05-29 23:25:22'),
  hour: 21,
  minute: 22,
  second: 22,
})

// Output: Date { 2020-05-29T21:22:22.000Z }
```
