## Knowledge Recap

#### General

##### Check the Repo Content

The learner must create a Gitea repository named `knowledge-recap`. This repository should contain:

- A `README.md` file that introduces the learner's goals for the program.
- A markdown file (`deep-in-net.md`) containing the reflection for the completed project.

###### Is the repository named `knowledge-recap`?

###### Is the repository public and accessible?

###### Is there a `README.md` file at the root of the repo?

###### Does the `README.md` include the learner’s personal goals, motivation, and expectations from the program?

###### Is there an additional markdown file for `deep-in-net` completed project?

##### Ask the following questions to the learner

- Why is it important to reflect after completing a project?
- What value do you see in documenting your process and challenges?

###### Did the learner respond thoughtfully to the questions?

1. What did you learn?
2. How did you learn it?
3. What issues or blockers did you face?
4. How did you solve or work around them?
5. What skills did you improve?
6. If you had to redo the project, what would you change?
7. How does this project relate to your long-term goals?

###### Are all 7 questions answered clearly for each project?

###### Are the reflections specific and written in the learner’s own words?

###### Are the reflections consistent and updated across different projects?

###### Did the learner include screenshots, diagrams, or code snippets?
