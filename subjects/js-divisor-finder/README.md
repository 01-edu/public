### Instructions

Write a function that takes an integer `n` and returns an array containing all of its positive divisors excluding itself. A divisor is a number that divides `n` without leaving a remainder.

### Expected function

```javascript
function divisors(n) {}
```

### Usage

Here is a possible program to test your function:

```javascript
console.log(divisors(15));
console.log(divisors(28));
console.log(divisors(1));
console.log(divisors(-15));
```

And its output:

```console
$ node main.js
[1, 3, 5]
[1, 2, 4, 7, 14]
[]
[1, 3, 5]
$
```
