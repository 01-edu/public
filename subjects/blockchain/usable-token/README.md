## Usable Token

### Instructions

- Create a Smart Contract named `UsableToken`
- Like MinimalToken, its constructor takes as parameter an amount that is given initially to the deployer.
- Create a function `approve(address,uint)` that allows the owner of the token to approve a spender to spend a certain amount of tokens.
- Create a function `allowance(address,uint)` that returns the amount of tokens that a spender can spend on behalf of the owner.
