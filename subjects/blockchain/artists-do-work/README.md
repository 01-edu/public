# Artists Do Work

Artists deserve to be payed too! Along the way, we will learn payments and divisions in Solidity

### Instructions

- Create a Smart Contract `ArtistsDoWork` with a function `buyTicket()` that takes no parameters and allows a user to buy a ticket paying 0.1 ether or more.
- Add the `addRemuneratedArtist()` function that takes as parameters an `address` to register an artist in the festival. Only the organizer that deployed the Smart Contract can trigger that function
- Add a function `getPayed()` that takes no parameters and that allows an artist, registered with the function above, to receive 1 Ether **once**, providing that there are enough funds in the Smart Contract!
