# Register With Events

In order to facilitate the use of your Smart Contract, you will add events.

Events in solidity are used to facilitate the retrieval of information.

### Instructions

Write solidity smart contract `RegisterWithEvents` that provides:

- The functions `addDocument()` and `getDate()` as specified in the prior exercise.
- An event `event DocumentAdded(bytes32, uint)` that triggers when a new document is added to the register

As in prior exercises, the file must be named register-with-events.sol while the contract is named RegisterWithEvents.
