# Minimal Token

It is now time to create our first token. We will start with a minmal implementation of a token.

### Instructions

- Create a Smart Contract `MinimalToken`

- Create a `constructor` function that takes a positive number as parameter and give an initial balance of tokens to the contract deployer.

- Create a public function `balanceOf(address)` to retrieve the balance of each user given an address

_Hint: You can declare a variable public to have an implicit public getter function of the same name._

- Create a function `transfer(address,uint)` that takes as parameters an address and a positive integer and, providing the sender has sufficient funds, moves the token to the provided address.
