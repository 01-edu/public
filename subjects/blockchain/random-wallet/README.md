# Random Wallet

You will have to create a simple web-based wallet.

### Instructions

- Create a web page, `randomWallet.html` that loads an ethereum library and connects to a local node `http://localhost:8545`.
- When loaded the page generates a new wallet.
- The address of the wallet is displayed in an HTML element with id `address`.
- The balance of this address is displayed in an HTML element with id `balance`.
- A button, with id `refreshBalance` refreshes the balance.

### Hint

You might need to send Ether from one of the default accounts of your local node to test the wallet. You could use the `send ether` exercise from the prior quest.
