## Lineup

For this to be a good festival, you need to register artists. Hip hip hip, arrays!

### Instructions

- Create a new Smart Contract `Lineup`.
- Create a function `addArtist(string)` that takes as parameter a string. Artists are added in their order of registration.
- Create a function`lineup(uint)` that given an index returns the name of corresponding artist.

### Hint

Public variables offer an implicit getter function
