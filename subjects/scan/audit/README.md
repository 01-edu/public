#### Functional

###### Is VirtualBox installed?

###### Are the 2 VMs, 01_scan_RRF-CONTROL and 01_scan_laptop, properly added to VirtualBox?

#### General

##### Ask the auditee, from the VM laptop, to get into the other VM. As a reminder the port forwarding is set to 10122.

##### (Allow some time for the hacking to take place)

###### Did the auditee manage to get `RRF-control` appearing on the laptop VM (did the auditee manage to get thru)?
