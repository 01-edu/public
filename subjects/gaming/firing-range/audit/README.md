#### Functional

###### Are the map size (X = 35, Y = 40, Z = 1) and composition (using cubes) being respected?

###### Are the projectile size (X = Y = Z = 0,5) and speed (10000) being respected?

###### If you try to move the target to the target zone, is the player forbidden from trespassing to that zone by an invisible wall?

###### When you shoot a target, does the bullet go through the invisible wall?

###### Did the targets correctly lay on the floor when hit by the projectile?

###### Did the target rotate from the bottom and not from the center?

###### Is there only one class “BP_Target” present on the project?

###### Do all the public variables have a tooltip? (Mouse over it to check if a description is set or check if the variable have a little green eye on the right)

#### Bonus

###### +Do different targets have different speeds?

###### +Do the walls and floor have texture?

###### +Are there obstacles in front of targets?
