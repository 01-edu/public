###### Do all interaction points led you to the location they tell you?

###### Can we play the whole game without pressing any key on the keyboard?

###### Is a "Quit Game" interaction point always available, so that it is possible to quit the game at any point of the game?

###### Are all teleportation visible to the player smooth and non brutal?

###### Is a sphere being used to cast instead of a single ray, in other words, did the student used a SphereTraceByChannel node?

###### Is an Interface Blueprint being used to handle the different actions on the interaction point (Blur,Focus and Active)?

###### Do you need to stare for a little at an interaction point to be able to teleport to a different scene?

###### Except for the interaction point and the spheres containing the panoramic images, are there any 3D objects on the map?
