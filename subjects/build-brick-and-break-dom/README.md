## Build brick and break

### Instructions

Today, your mission is to build a 3-column brick tower, maintain it and finally break it!

- Create a function `build` which will create and display the given amount of bricks passed as argument:

  - each brick has to be created as a `div` and added to the page at a regular interval of 100ms,
  - each brick will receive a unique `id` property, like following:

  ```html
  <div id="brick-1"></div>
  ```

  - each brick in the middle column has to be set with the custom data attribute `foundation` receiving the value `true`

- Each one of the two emojis in the top-right corner fires a function on click:

  - ðŸ”¨ triggers the function `repair`: write the body of that function, which receives any number of `ids`, and for each `id`, retrieves the HTML element and set a custom attribute `repaired` set to `in progress` if it is a brick situated in the middle column, and `true` if not
  - ðŸ§¨ triggers the function `destroy`: write the body of that function, which removes the current last brick in the tower
