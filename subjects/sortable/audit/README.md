#### Functionals

###### Does the data appear in a table element?

###### Does the table presents just the requested data (icon, name, full name, powerstats, race, gender, height, weight, place of birth, alignment), instead of all of it?

###### Are there different pages that display different information?

###### Can you change the amount of results displayed between **10**, **20**, **50**, **100** or **all results**?

###### Does the table initially displays 20 results?

###### Are the results initially sorted by the column **name** by **ascending** order?

###### Are all columns of the table clickable in order to sort the results?

##### Try to click once to sort the table by weight.

###### Did the results became sorted numerically by weight in **ascending** order? (be aware that cases like [75 kg, 100kg] should be in that order and not the other way around)

##### Try to click twice to sort the by place of birth.

###### Did the results became sorted alphabetically by place of birth in **descending** order?

##### Try to click several times on a column and observe its behavior.

###### Did the results became sorted in **ascending** and **descending** order, alternately?

##### Try to search for `Superman`.

###### Are the missing values always shown last?

###### As you type, does the results on the table change?

##### Write only `Cat` on the search field.

###### Does Catwoman appear on the results?

###### Does the project contains the use of `fetch`?

###### Confirm that no frameworks or librairies where used

#### Bonus

###### +Can you search for any fields apart from the name?

###### +Can you do a search with search operators (include/exclude for strings and equal/not equal/greater than/lesser than)?

###### +If you click on a hero, does the site displays the details and a large image of it?

###### +Does the URL changes when you make a search?

###### +After making a search and the URL changes, if you copy and paste it in a different window, are the results displayed in the table the same as the ones from the search?

###### +Does the project runs quickly and effectively? (Favoring recursive, no unnecessary data requests, etc)

###### +Does the code obey the [good practices](https://public.01-edu.org/subjects/good-practices/README.md)?
