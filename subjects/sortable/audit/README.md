#### Functional

###### Does the data appear in a `<table>` element?

###### Does the table present just the required data (icon, name, full name, power stats, race, gender, height, weight, place of birth, alignment), instead of all of it?

###### Has client-side pagination been implemented? Are there different pages that display different information?

###### Does the table initially displays 20 results?

###### Can you change the page size to one of **10**, **20**, **50**, **100** or **all results**?

###### Are the results initially sorted by the **name** column in **ascending** order?

###### Are all columns of the table clickable in order to sort the results?

##### Try to click once to sort the table by weight.

###### Was the table sorted numerically by weight in **ascending** order? (be aware that cases like [75 kg, 100kg] should be in that order and not the other way around)

##### Try to click twice to sort the table by place of birth.

###### Were the results sorted alphabetically by place of birth in **descending** order?

##### Try to click several times on a column and observe its behavior.

###### Did the sort order toggle between **ascending** and **descending** order?

###### Are the missing values always shown last?

##### Write only `Cat` on the search field.

###### As you type, do the results on the table change?

###### Does Catwoman appear in the results?

###### Does the project contains the use of `fetch`?

##### Check the project to ensure that it does not use any libraries of frameworks (React, Vue, Svelte etc).

###### Is the project free of any frameworks or librairies?

#### Bonus

###### +Can you search for any fields apart from the name?

###### +Can you do a search with search these search operators: include/exclude for strings and equal/not equal/greater than/less than)?

###### +If you click on a hero, does the site display the details and a large image of it?

###### +Does the URL change when you make a search?

###### +After making a search and the URL changes, if you copy and paste it to a different tab, are the results displayed in the table the same as the ones from the previous tab?

###### +Does the project run quickly and effectively? (Favoring recursive, no unnecessary data requests, etc)?

###### +Does the code obey the [good practices](https://public.01-edu.org/subjects/good-practices/README.md)?
