## Filter

### Instructions


Create the following functions, which each take an array as the first argument, and a function as the second argument.

- `filter`: that works like the `[].filter` method.

- `reject`: that works like the `reject` function from lodash.

- `partition`: that works like the `partition` function from lodash.
