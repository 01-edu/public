#### Functional

###### Has the requirement for the allowed packages been respected? (Reminder for this project: (only [standard packages](https://golang.org/pkg/)

###### Does the project have a DockerFile?

##### Try running the [command](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/image_build/) `"docker image build [OPTIONS] PATH | URL | -"` to build the image using the project Dockerfile. (example : `"docker image build -f Dockerfile -t <name_of_the_image> ."`).

```
student$ docker images
REPOSITORY              TAG                             IMAGE ID            CREATED             SIZE
<name of the image>     latest                          85a65d66ca39        7 seconds ago       795MB
```

###### Run the command `"docker images"` to see all images. Does the docker image build as above?

##### Try running the [command](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/container_run/) `"docker container run [OPTIONS] IMAGE [COMMAND] [ARG...]"` to start the container using the image just created. (example : `"docker container run -p <port_you_what_to_run> --detach --name <name_of_the_container> <name_of_the_image>"`)

```
student$ docker ps -a
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE                  COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS              PORTS                    NAMES
cc8f5dcf760f        ascii-art-web-docker   "./server"               6 seconds ago       Up 6 seconds        0.0.0.0:8080->8080/tcp   ascii-art-web
```

###### Run the command `"docker ps -a"` to see all containers. Is the docker container running as above?

##### Try running the [command](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/exec/) `"docker exec [OPTIONS] CONTAINER COMMAND [ARG...]"`. (example : `"docker exec -it <container_name> /bin/bash"`) and do a `"ls -l"` to see the file system.

```
student$ docker exec -it postgres /bin/bash
I have no name!@51c2efe2d366:/$ ls -l
drwxr-xr-x   1 root root 4096 Dec 28 15:31 bin

drwxr-xr-x   2 root root 4096 Sep  8 10:51 templates
I have no name!@51c2efe2d366:/$ exit
exit
student$
```

###### Is the file system for the containers well organized?

###### Does the DockerFile contain some [metadata](https://docs.docker.com/config/labels-custom-metadata/) applied to the docker object?

###### Does the project present no [unused object](https://docs.docker.com/config/pruning/)?

###### As an auditor, is this project up to every standard? If not, why are you failing the project?(Empty Work, Incomplete Work, Invalid compilation, Cheating, Crashing, Leaks)

#### General

#### Basic

###### +Does the server run quickly and effectively? (Favoring recursive, no unnecessary data requests, etc)
