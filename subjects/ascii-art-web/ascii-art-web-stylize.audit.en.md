###### Is the design [responsive](https://smallbiztrends.com/2013/05/what-is-responsive-web-design.html)? (when you change the width/ height of the page, is the site consistent?)

###### Is the design [interactive](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interactive_design)? (does it interact with the actions of the user?)
