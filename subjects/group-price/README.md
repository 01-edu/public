## Group Price

### Instructions

Create a `groupPrice` function, that can find a price in a given string.
The function has to return an array of arrays with the full match of the price ($43.99)
and the groups of that price, the first group(43) and the second group (99).
If there is no match the function returns an empty array.
Example:
"The price is USD12.31"
Expected output:
[["USD12.31","12","31"]]
