## Dog Years

### Instructions

Someone once said that a human year is equal to 7 dog years.

Create a function named `dogYears`, that accepts the name of a planet, and the age of the dog in seconds. Your function should return the age of the dog on that planet in dog years.

- `earth`: orbital period 1.0 Earth years, 365.25 Earth days, or 31,557,600 seconds.
- `mercury`: orbital period 0.2408467 Earth years.
- `venus`: orbital period 0.61519726 Earth years.
- `mars`: orbital period 1.8808158 Earth years.
- `jupiter`: orbital period 11.862615 Earth years.
- `saturn`: orbital period 29.447498 Earth years.
- `uranus`: orbital period 84.016846 Earth years.
- `neptune`: orbital period 164.79132 Earth years.

If you were told that a dog was 1,000,000,000 seconds old, you should calculate that the dog would be 221.82 Earth-years old.

You will have to format the number so that the result is rounded like the example above.
