## Dog Years

### Instructions

Someone once said that a dog makes 7 years for each human year.

Create a `dogYears` function that if given a planet name and an age in seconds,
calculates how old a dog would be on the given planet.

- `earth` : orbital period 1.0 Earth years, 365.25 Earth days, or 31,557,600 seconds
- `mercury` : orbital period 0.2408467 Earth years
- `venus` : orbital period 0.61519726 Earth years
- `mars` : orbital period 1.8808158 Earth years
- `jupiter` : orbital period 11.862615 Earth years
- `saturn` : orbital period 29.447498 Earth years
- `uranus` : orbital period 84.016846 Earth years
- `neptune` : orbital period 164.79132 Earth years

So if you were told someone that their dog were 1,000,000,000 seconds old, you should be able to say that the dog is 221.82 Earth-years old.

You will have to format the number so that the result is rounded like the example above.
