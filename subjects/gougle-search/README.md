## Gougle Search

### Instructions

Create the `queryServers` function, that takes 2 arguments:
- `serverName` a string of the name of the server
- `q` a string of the query given by the user

You have to construct 2 urls, using `q` as a search parameter,
prepending a `'/'` and for the 2nd appending `'_backup'`.

Then return the first value of those 2 calls

```js
queryServers('pouet', 'hello+world')
  // return the fastest of those 2 calls:
  // -> getJSON('/pouet?q=hello+world')
  // -> getJSON('/pouet_backup?q=hello+world')
```


Create a `gougleSearch` function that takes a single query argument.
It must call `queryServers` in concurrently on 3 servers:
`'web'`, `'image'` and `'video'`.

A timeout of 80milliseconds must be set for the whole operation.

You must return the value from each servers in an object
using a the server name as key.
