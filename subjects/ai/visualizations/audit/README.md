#### Exercise 0: Environment and libraries

##### The exercise is validated if all questions of the exercise are validated

##### Activate the virtual environment. If you used `conda` run `conda activate your_env`

##### Run `python --version`

###### Does it print `Python 3.x`? x >= 9

###### Do `import jupyter`, `import numpy`, `import pandas`, `matplotlib` and `plotly` run without any errors?

#### Exercise 5: Matplotlib subplots

###### For question 1, does the plot reproduces the plot in the image and respect those criteria?

###### Does it contain 6 subplots (2 rows, 3 columns)?

###### Does it have space between plots (`hspace=0.5` and `wspace=0.5`)?

###### Do all subplots contain a title: `Title i`?

###### Do all subplots contain a text `(2,3,i)` centered at `(0.5, 0.5)`? _Hint_: check the parameter `ha` of `text`.

###### Have all subplots been created in a for loop?

#### Exercise 7: Plotly Box plots

###### For question 1, does the plot reproduce the plot in the image as asked in the subject?

###### Does the figure as 3 box plots?

###### Does the 3 box plots show normal distributions around 0, 1 and 2 respectively?

Due to the random nature of the distributions, the two graphs do not require a perfect match
