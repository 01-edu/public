## Classification

### Overview

Today's goal is to understand practical classification with Scikit Learn.

### Role Play

Imagine you're a data scientist working for a cutting-edge medical research company. Your team has been tasked with developing a machine learning model to assist doctors in diagnosing breast cancer. You'll be using logistic regression to classify tumors as benign or malignant based on various features.

### Learning Objectives

Today we will learn a different approach in Machine Learning: classification, which is a large domain in the field of statistics and machine learning. Generally, it can be broken down into two areas:

- **Binary classification**, where we group an outcome into one of two categories.
- **Multi-class classification**, where we group an outcome into one of multiple (more than two) categories.

You may wonder why the approach is different from regression and why we don't use regression and define a threshold where the class would be 1 if the threshold is met, or 0 otherwise—in binary classification. The main reason is that linear regression is sensitive to outliers, causing the threshold to vary depending on the outliers in the data. An article explains this concept using plots. To keep things simple, we can say that the output needed in classification is a probability of belonging to one of the classes. By definition, the value output by the classification model must be between 0 and 1. Linear regression cannot satisfy this constraint.

In mathematics, there are functions with nice properties that take as input a real number (-∞, ∞) and output a value between 0 and 1. The most popular of these is the **sigmoid function**, which is the inverse function of the logit—hence the name logistic regression.

Let's take a small example to better understand the steps needed to perform logistic regression on binary data. Let's assume that we want to predict gender based on people's size (height).

Logistic regression steps:

- Fit a sigmoid function on the training data.
- Compute sigmoid(size)=0.7 because the sigmoid returns values between 0 and 1.
- Return the class: 0.7 > 0.5 => class 1. Thus, the gender is male.

For linear regression exercises, the loss (Mean Squared Error - MSE) is minimized using an algorithm called **gradient descent**. In classification, MSE loss cannot be used because the model's output is 0 or 1 (for binary classification).

The **log-loss** or **cross-entropy** is the loss used for classification. Similarly, it has some nice mathematical properties. Minimizing the **log-loss** is not covered in these exercises. However, since it is used in most machine learning models for classification, I recommend spending some time reading the related article.

### Exercise 0: Environment and libraries

The goal of this exercise is to set up the Python work environment with the required libraries.

**Note:** For each quest, your first exercise will be to set up the virtual environment with the required libraries.

We recommend using:

- The **last stable versions** of Python.
- The virtual environment you're the most comfortable with. `virtualenv` and `conda` are the most used in Data Science.
- One of the most recent versions of the libraries required.

1. Create a virtual environment named `ex00`, with a version of Python >= `3.9`, with the following libraries: `pandas`, `numpy`, `jupyter`, `matplotlib` and `scikit-learn`.

### Exercise 1: Logistic regression in Scikit-learn

The goal of this exercise is to learn to use Scikit-learn to classify data.

```python
X = [[0],[0.1],[0.2], [1],[1.1],[1.2], [1.3]]
y = [0,0,0,1,1,1,0]
```

1. Predict the class for `x_pred = [[0.5]]`.

2. Predict the probabilities for `x_pred = [[0.5]]` using `predict_proba`.

3. Print the coefficients (`coef_`), the intercept (`intercept_`) and the score of the logistic regression of X and y.

---

---

### Exercise 2: Sigmoid

The goal of this exercise is to learn to compute and plot the sigmoid function.

1. On the same plot, plot the sigmoid function and the custom sigmoids defined as:

- `sigmoid1(x) = 1/(1+ exp(-(0.5*x + 3)))`

- `sigmoid2(x) = 1/(1+ exp(-(5*x + 11)))`

- Add a line representing the probability=0.5

The plot should look like this:

### Exercise 3: Decision boundary

The goal of this exercise is to learn to fit a logistic regression on simple examples and to understand how the algorithm separated the data from the different classes.

#### 1 dimension

First, we will start as usual with features data in 1 dimension. Use `make classification` from Scikit-learn to generate 100 data points:

```python
X,y = make_classification(
    n_samples=100,
    n_features=1,
    n_informative=1,
    n_redundant=0,
    n_repeated=0,
    n_classes=2,
    n_clusters_per_class=1,
    weights=[0.5,0.5],
    flip_y=0.15,
    class_sep=2.0,
    hypercube=True,
    shift=1.0,
    scale=1.0,
    shuffle=True,
    random_state=88
)
```

_Warning: The shape of X is not the same as the shape of y. You may need (for some questions) to reshape X using: `X.reshape(1,-1)[0]`._

1. Plot the data using a scatter plot. The x-axis contains the feature and y-axis contains the target.

The plot should look like this:

![alt text][ex3q1]

[ex3q3]: ./w2_day2_ex3_q3.png "Scatter plot"

2. Fit a Logistic Regression on the generated data using scikit learn. Print the coefficients and the interception of the Logistic Regression.

3. Add to the previous plot the fitted sigmoid and the 0.5 probability line. The plot should look like this:

![alt text][ex3q3]

[ex3q1]: ./w2_day2_ex3_q1.png "Scatter plot + Logistic regression"

4.  Create a function `predict_probability` that takes as input the data point and the coefficients and that returns the predicted probability. As a reminder, the probability is given by: `p(x) = 1/(1+ exp(-(coef*x + intercept)))`. Check you have the same results as the method `predict_proba` from Scikit-learn.

```python
def predict_probability(coefs, X):
    '''
    coefs is a list that contains a and b: [coef, intercept]
    X is the features set

    Returns probability of X
    '''
    #TODO
    probabilities =

    return probabilities
```

5. Create a function `predict_class` that takes as input the data point and the coefficients and that returns the predicted class. Check you have the same results as the class method `predict` output on the same data.

6. On the plot add the predicted class. The plot should look like this (the predicted class is shifted a bit to make the plot more understandable, but obviously the predicted class is 0 or 1, not 0.1 or 0.9)
   The plot should look like this:

![alt text][ex3q6]

[ex3q6]: ./w2_day2_ex3_q5.png "Scatter plot + Logistic regression + predictions"

#### 2 dimensions

Now, let us repeat this process on 2-dimensional data. The goal is to focus on the decision boundary and to understand how the Logistic Regression create a line that separates the data. The code to plot the decision boundary is provided, however it is important to understand the way it works.

- Generate 500 data points using:

```python
X, y = make_classification(n_features=2,
                           n_redundant=0,
                           n_samples=250,
                           n_classes=2,
                           n_clusters_per_class=1,
                           flip_y=0.05,
                           class_sep=3,
                           random_state=43)
```

7. Fit the Logistic Regression on X and y and use the code below to plot the fitted sigmoid on the data set.

The plot should look like this:

![alt text][ex3q7]

[ex3q7]: ./w2_day2_ex3_q6.png "Logistic regression decision boundary"

```python
xx, yy = np.mgrid[-5:5:.01, -5:5:.01]
grid = np.c_[xx.ravel(), yy.ravel()]
#if needed change the line below
probs = clf.predict_proba(grid)[:, 1].reshape(xx.shape)

f, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(8, 6))
contour = ax.contourf(xx, yy, probs, 25, cmap="RdBu",
                      vmin=0, vmax=1)
ax_c = f.colorbar(contour)
ax_c.set_label("$P(y = 1)$")
ax_c.set_ticks([0, .25, .5, .75, 1])

ax.scatter(X[:,0], X[:, 1], c=y, s=50,
           cmap="RdBu", vmin=-.2, vmax=1.2,
           edgecolor="white", linewidth=1)

ax.set(aspect="equal",
       xlim=(-5, 5), ylim=(-5, 5),
       xlabel="$X_1$", ylabel="$X_2$")

```

The plot should look like this:

### Exercise 4: Train test split

The goal of this exercise is to learn to split a classification data set. The idea is the same as splitting a regression data set but there's one important detail specific to the classification: the proportion of each class in the train set and test set.

```python
   X = np.arange(1,21).reshape(10,-1)
   y = np.zeros(10)
   y[7:] = 1
```

1. Split the data using `train_test_split` with `shuffle=False`. The test set represents 20% of the total size of the data set. Print X_train, y_train, X_test, y_test. Compute the proportion of class `1` on the train set and test set.

2. Having a train set with different properties than the test set is not recommended. The analogy of the exam (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vdMKioCXqQ) helps to understand this point: if the questions you have at the exam are completely different from what you prepared for you are not evaluated on what you learn. The training set has to be representative of the data set. Now, split the data in a train set and test set, but keep the proportion of class `1` nearly constant. The parameter `shuffle` in theory works as it relies on a random sampling. The parameter `stratify` will always split the data and keep the same proportion of class `1` in the train set and test set. Using the parameter `stratify` split the data below and print the proportion of class `1` in the train set and train set.

```python
X = np.arange(1,201).reshape(100,-1)
y = np.zeros(100)
y[70:] = 1
```

### Exercise 5: Breast Cancer prediction

The goal of this exercise is to use Logistic Regression
to predict breast cancer. It is always important to understand the data before training any Machine Learning algorithm. The data is described in **breast-cancer-wisconsin.names**. I suggest to add manually the column names in the DataFrame.

Preliminary:

- If needed, replace missing values with the median of the column.

- Handle the column `Sample code number`. This column won't be used to train the model as it doesn't contain information on breast cancer. There are two solutions: drop it or set it as index.

1. Print the proportion of class `Benign`. What would be the accuracy if the model always predicts `Benign`?
   Later this week we will learn about other metrics as AUC that will help us to tackle high imbalanced data sets.

2. Using train_test_split, split the data set in a train set and test set (20%). Both sets should have approximately the same proportion of class `Benign`. Use `random_state = 43`.

3. Fit the logistic regression on the train set. Predict on the train set and test set. Compute the score on the train set and test set. 92-97% accuracy is expected on the test set.

4. Compute the confusion matrix on both tests. Analyse the number of false negative and false positive.

### Exercise 6: Multi-class (Optional)

The goal of this exercise is to learn to train a classification algorithm on a multi-class labelled data.
Some algorithms as SVM or Logistic Regression do not natively support multi-class (more than 2 classes). There are some approaches that allow to use these algorithms on multi-class data.
Let's assume we work with 3 classes: A, B and C.

- One-vs-Rest considers 3 binary classification problems: A vs B,C; B vs A,C and C vs A,B. If there are 10 classes, 10 binary classification problems would be fitted.
- One-vs-One considers 3 binary classification problems: A vs B, A vs C, B vs C. If there are 10 classes, 45 binary classification problems would be fitted. Given, the volume of data, this technique may not be scalable.

More details:

- [Multiclass classification](https://medium.com/@agrawalsam1997/multiclass-classification-onevsrest-and-onevsone-classification-strategy-2c293a91571a)

Let's implement the One-vs-Rest approach from `LogisticRegression`.

Preliminary:

- Import the Setosa data set from Scikit-learn

```python
from sklearn.datasets import load_iris
iris = load_iris()

X = pd.DataFrame(data=iris['data'], columns=iris.feature_names)
y = pd.DataFrame(data=iris['target'], columns=['target'])
```

- Using train_test_split, split the data set in a train set and test set (20%) with `shuffle=True` and `random_state=43`.

1. Create a function that takes as input the data and returns three **trained** classifiers.

- `clf0` takes as input a binary data set where the class 1 is `0` and class 0 is `1` and `2`.
- `clf1` takes as input a binary data set where the class 1 is `1` and class 0 is `0` and `2`.
- `clf2` takes as input a binary data set where the class 1 is `2` and class 0 is `0` and `1`.

```python
def train(X_train,y_train):
       #TODO
       return clf0, clf1, clf2
```

2. Create a function that takes as input the trained classifiers and the features set and that returns the predicted class. Use `predict_one_vs_all` to output the predicted classes on the test set. Compare the results with Logistic Regression algorithm from scikit learn used in One-vs-All mode. The results may change because the solver may not converge. Later this week, we will learn to preprocess the data to avoid convergence issues.

- `clf0` outputs the probability to belong to the class 1 which is `0`.
- `clf1` outputs the probability to belong to the class 1 which is `1`.
- `clf2` outputs the probability to belong to the class 1 which is `2`.

The predicted class is the one that gets the **highest probability** among the three models.

```python
def predict_one_vs_all(X, clf0, clf1, clf2 ):
       #TODO
       return classes
```
