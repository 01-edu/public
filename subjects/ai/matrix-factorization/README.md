This project implements an advanced movie recommender system using matrix factorization techniques. The system is built with **Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)** and **Probabilistic Matrix Factorization (PMF)** to provide personalized recommendations based on user preferences. It also includes an interactive dashboard using **Streamlit** that allows users to input their user ID and receive recommendations, while visualizing the differences between SVD and PMF predictions.

### Learning Objective

The goal of this project is to understand and apply advanced matrix factorization techniques in building recommender systems. By comparing two different models (SVD and PMF), you'll gain insights into their performance and how they generate recommendations. You'll also learn to integrate these models into an interactive interface using **Streamlit** for real-time interaction.

### Instructions

#### Data Loading and Preprocessing

1. **Download the [MovieLens Dataset](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/1m/)** (ratings, users, and movies).
2. Preprocess the dataset to remove null values and prepare it for matrix factorization.
3. Create a user-item interaction matrix from the data.
4. Split the data into training and testing sets using a fixed `random_state = 42`.
5. Normalize the user–item interaction matrix and save it under `processed/user_item_matrix.csv`.

#### Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) Model

1. Implement the SVD algorithm using the **scipy.sparse.linalg.svds** function for matrix factorization.
2. Train the SVD model on the MovieLens dataset to generate predicted ratings for all users.
3. Compute RMSE on the test set and append the value to `reports/model_metrics.json`.
4. Save the full predicted rating matrix as `reports/svd_predictions.npy`.

#### Probabilistic Matrix Factorization (PMF) Model

1. Implement the PMF algorithm.
2. Train the PMF model and visualize the model's convergence (e.g., plot Mean Squared Error over iterations).
3. During training, log the Mean Squared Error (MSE) at each iteration/epoch.
4. Generate and save a convergence plot (`MSE vs. iteration`) as `reports/pmf_convergence.png`.
5. Save the learned latent factor matrices (`U` and `V`) under `reports/pmf_factors/`.

#### Model Comparison and Evaluation

1. Compare the performance of SVD and PMF using evaluation metrics such as **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**.
2. Provide visual comparisons between the models using **matplotlib** to plot predicted vs. actual ratings.
3. Save consolidated evaluation results as JSON:
   `reports/model_metrics.json`

   Example format:

   ```json
   {
     "SVD_RMSE": 0.91,
     "PMF_RMSE": 0.85,
     "PMF_vs_SVD_improvement_%": 6.6
   }
   ```

   - Generate and save comparison plots:
     - Predicted vs Actual ratings: `reports/predicted_vs_actual.png`
     - RMSE comparison (bar chart): `reports/rmse_comparison.png`
   - Minimum expected performance:
     - SVD RMSE ≤ 0.90
     - PMF RMSE ≤ 0.85
     - PMF improvement ≥ 5% over SVD

#### Recommendation Generation

1. Implement a function that generates movie recommendations for a user based on the predicted ratings from both the SVD and PMF models.
2. Display top-rated movies for users and compare recommendations from both models.
3. Implement in `utils/recommendation.py`:

```python
def generate_recommendations(user_id, model, top_n=10):
    ...
```

4. Save the top-10 recommendations for each evaluated user in `reports/user_<id>_recommendations.csv`

#### Analysis and Visualization

1. Provide visualizations comparing SVD and PMF predictions for the same user.
2. Offer insights into how the models differ in recommending movies for specific users based on their ratings history.
3. Save the following plots under `reports/`:
   - `user_comparison.png` — SVD vs PMF predictions for a selected user
   - `top_recommendations.png` — Histogram (or bar chart) of top recommended movies

#### Streamlit Dashboard

1. Build an interactive **Streamlit** dashboard that takes a **user ID** as input and returns the following:
   - List of top-rated movies for the user.
   - Movie recommendations from both the **SVD** and **PMF** models.
   - Visual comparison of the SVD vs. PMF predictions for the user.
2. Ensure real-time interaction, with recommendations and visualizations updating dynamically based on user input.
3. The app must run successfully via: `streamlit run app.py`

### Tips

Remember, a great recommender system needs to understand both the users and the content. Keep in mind the trade-off between model complexity and interpretability. Here are some additional considerations:

- Code Quality: Is the code well-documented and following good coding practices? Clearly labeled functions, docstrings, and a consistent style will make the project easier to understand and maintain.
- Error Handling: Include checks and error messages for unexpected user inputs on the Streamlit dashboard.
- Efficiency: For large datasets, consider optimizing your code to avoid memory bottlenecks, especially in matrix operations.
  Parameter Tuning: Experiment with model parameters for SVD and PMF to find the best-performing configuration.
- User Experience: Consider adding features like a search bar for movies or a "surprise me" option for diverse recommendations.
