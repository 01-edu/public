## Spectral Learning

### Overview

This project explores spectral methods in machine learning, focusing on **dimensionality reduction techniques** to simplify high-dimensional data, uncover patterns, and enhance interpretability. By applying eigenvalue decomposition and matrix factorization techniques, the system reduces data complexity, making it easier to analyze and visualize. The project emphasizes implementing **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** and **Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)** from **scratch**, aiming to understand the underlying mechanics of these algorithms without relying on scikit-learn or SciPy’s core PCA and SVD functions.

Note: Explore applications of PCA and SVD in image compression and signal processing to understand their broader utility.

### Learning Objective

The primary goal of this project is to **develop** an in-depth understanding of **spectral learning techniques** by applying **PCA** and **SVD** on high-dimensional datasets from scratch. You will **explore eigenvalue decomposition** and **matrix factorization**, observe how dimensionality reduction techniques affect data representation, and understand how these representations impact tasks like clustering and classification.

### Role play

You are a junior data scientist working at a tech company. Your manager assigns you a challenging project: analyzing a massive dataset collected from a new product launch. The data is noisy, high-dimensional, and difficult to interpret. The company needs insights fast to steer their marketing strategy.

Your task is to reduce the complexity of the dataset while retaining the most meaningful patterns. You will implement PCA and SVD from scratch to better understand the mechanics of these techniques and communicate the results to a cross-functional team, including business analysts and marketing managers.

### Instructions

#### Data Loading

1. **Dataset Preparation**:

   - Use the **Wine Quality** dataset [DataSet](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/186/wine+quality), or another high-dimensional dataset with numerical features.
   - Perform data cleaning and preprocessing (handle missing values and standardize the format).

2. **Matrix Preparation**:
   - Construct and normalize a suitable feature matrix for decomposition.

#### Principal Component Analysis (PCA) from Scratch

1. Implement PCA without external libraries for matrix decomposition:
   - Use NumPy for basic matrix operations, ensuring no dependency on `scikit-learn`.
2. **Procedure**:
   - Calculate covariance, eigenvalues, and eigenvectors.
   - Sort eigenvalues and retain top components for dimensionality reduction.
3. Visualize cumulative variance to determine how well PCA reduces data complexity.

#### Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) from Scratch

1. Implement SVD from scratch without relying on `scipy.sparse.linalg.svds` or similar:
   - Decompose the matrix into U, Σ, and Vᵀ components using NumPy for matrix operations.
2. Apply SVD for dimensionality reduction and visualize results, comparing it with PCA.
3. Functions for matrix operations should be reusable across both PCA and SVD scripts.

### Model Evaluation

1. **Variance Explained**:

   - Calculate and display the **variance explained** by PCA and SVD to evaluate the effectiveness of each technique.

2. **Clustering Metrics**:

   - Apply clustering (e.g., K-means) on reduced dimensions and calculate clustering accuracy or separability scores.

3. **Learning Curves and Overfitting Prevention**:

   - Plot learning curves or cumulative variance to demonstrate model convergence and sufficiency of components, and note strategies to prevent overfitting where applicable.

4. **Dimensionality Reduction and Feature Extraction**:
   - Extract key principal components and analyze latent components captured through PCA and SVD, providing insights into the data structure.

#### Visualization and Interpretation

1. **2D and 3D Visualizations**:

   - Use `Matplotlib` and `Seaborn` for 2D/3D visualizations showing clusters or separation in reduced-dimensional space.

2. **Variance Comparison**:

   - Present side-by-side variance comparisons for `PCA` and `SVD` to clarify interpretability.

3. **Clustering Patterns**:
   - Visualize clustering patterns, showing examples across various data subsets to highlight dimensionality reduction effectiveness.

### Tips

Dimensionality reduction helps simplify complex datasets, but it is essential to balance accuracy with interpretability. Focus on variance explained and clustering accuracy to ensure meaningful patterns are retained.

1. **Code Quality and Documentation**:

   - Document each function and class with comments explaining parameters, outputs, and functionality.

2. **Advanced Techniques**:

   - Optionally experiment with non-linear dimensionality reduction methods like t-SNE or UMAP for insights into complex data patterns.

3. **Error Handling**:
   - Implement robust error handling, particularly for data loading, matrix operations, and visualizations to improve stability.
