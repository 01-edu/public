#### Exercise 0: Environment and libraries

##### The exercise is validated if all questions of the exercise are validated.

##### Activate the virtual environment. If you used `conda` run `conda activate your_env`.

##### Run `python --version`.

---

#### Exercise 1: MSE Scikit-learn

###### Is the Mean Squared Error (MSE) calculated using the `sklearn.metrics` library?

###### Is the Mean Squared Error (MSE) correctly computed for the given `y_true` and `y_pred` values, and does the calculated MSE match the expected value?

---

---

#### Exercise 2: Accuracy Scikit-learn

###### Is the accuracy computed using the `sklearn.metrics` library?

###### Is the accuracy correctly calculated for the given `y_true` and `y_pred` values, and does the calculated accuracy match the expected value?

#### Exercise 3: Regression

##### The exercise is validated if all questions of the exercise are validated

###### For question 1, are the predictions on the train set and test set the following?

```console
    #10 first values Train
array([1.54505951, 2.21338527, 2.2636205 , 3.3258957 , 1.51710076,
    1.63209319, 2.9265211 , 0.78080924, 1.21968217, 0.72656239])

```

```console
#10 first values Test

array([ 1.82212706,  1.98357668,  0.80547979, -0.19259114,  1.76072418,
        3.27855815,  2.12056804,  1.96099917,  2.38239663,  1.21005304])

```

###### For question 2, Do the results match the following output (ensure that at least the first 3 decimal digits match)?

```console
r2 on the train set: 0.6079874818809449
MAE on the train set:  0.5300159371615256
MSE on the train set:  0.5210784446797679

r2 on the test set:  0.5903435927516574
MAE on the test set:  0.5454023699809112
MSE on the test set:  0.5537420654727396
```

This result shows that the model has slightly better results on the train set than the test set. That's frequent since it is easier to get a better grade on an exam we studied than an exam that is different from what was prepared. However, the results are not good: r2 ~ 0.3. Fitting non linear models as the Random Forest on this data may improve the results. That's the goal of the exercise 5.

#### Exercise 4: Classification

##### The exercise is validated if all questions of the exercise are validated

###### For question 1, are the predictions on the train set and test set the following?

```console
    # 10 first values Train
    array([1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0])

    # 10 first values Test
    array([1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0])
```

###### For question 2, do the results match this output?

```console
F1 on the train set:  0.9911504424778761
Accuracy on the train set:  0.989010989010989
Recall on the train set:  0.9929078014184397
Precision on the train set:  0.9893992932862191
ROC_AUC on the train set:  0.9990161111794368


F1 on the test set:  0.9801324503311258
Accuracy on the test set:  0.9736842105263158
Recall on the test set:  0.9866666666666667
Precision on the test set:  0.9736842105263158
ROC_AUC on the test set:  0.9863247863247864
```

###### For question 2, do the results match the confusion matrix on the test set? It should be:

```console
array([[37,  2],
        [ 1, 74]])
```

###### For question 3, Does the ROC AUC plot look like the plot below?

![alt text][logo_ex4]

Having a 99% ROC AUC is not usual. The data set we used is easy to classify. On real data sets, always check if there's any leakage while having such a high ROC AUC score.

It is important to notice that the Decision Tree overfits very easily. It learns easily the training data but is not able to extrapolate on the test set. This algorithm is not used a lot because of its overfitting ability.

However, Random Forest and Gradient Boosting propose a solid approach to correct the overfitting (in that case the parameters `max_depth` is set to None that is why the Random Forest overfits the data). These two algorithms are used intensively in Machine Learning Projects.

#### Exercise 6: Grid Search

##### The exercise is validated if all questions of the exercise are validated

###### For question 1, is the code that runs the `gridsearch` like the following? (the parameters may change):

```python
parameters = {'n_estimators':[10, 50, 75],
            'max_depth':[3,5,7],
            'min_samples_leaf': [10,20,30]}

rf = RandomForestRegressor()
gridsearch = GridSearchCV(rf,
                        parameters,
                        cv = [(np.arange(18576), np.arange(18576,20640))],
                        n_jobs=-1)
gridsearch.fit(X, y)
```

###### For question 2, is the function as below?

```python
def select_model_verbose(gs):

    return gs.best_estimator_, gs.best_params_, gs.best_score_
```

In my case, the `gridsearch` parameters are not interesting. Even if I reduced the over-fitting of the Random Forest, the score on the test is lower than the score on the test returned by the Gradient Boosting in the previous exercise without optimal parameters search.

###### For question 3, is the code used the following?

```python
model, best_params, best_score = select_model_verbose(gridsearch)
model.predict(new_point)
```
