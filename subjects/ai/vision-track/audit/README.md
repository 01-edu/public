#### VisionTrack

##### Project Structure and Setup

###### Does the project structure match the setup outlined in the README, with organized folders for data, models, utilities, and documentation?

###### Does the README provide a comprehensive overview, including installation, setup instructions, and an explanation of the project’s objectives and usage?

###### Is a `requirements.txt` file included with all dependencies and specific library versions required to run the project?

###### import test `python -c "import torch, supervision, cv2, streamlit"`

##### Data Processing and Exploratory Data Analysis

###### Does the Jupyter notebook (`VisionTrack_Analysis.ipynb`) include EDA showcasing data distribution, object detection samples, and preprocessing methods?

###### Is the dataset loaded and preprocessed to remove anomalies, handle missing values, and prepare video/image frames for object detection and tracking?

###### Does data preprocessing include resizing and normalization, ensuring compatibility with YOLO model input formats?

- Validation of YOLO-compatible annotations (.txt files with class, x, y, w, h).
- Confirm frames are resized and normalized properly before inference.

##### Model Implementation

###### Is the YOLO model implemented for person detection with configuration options for detection thresholds and class-specific tuning?

###### Is the Transfer learning applied to adjust the pre-trained YOLO model to specific datasets for improved accuracy?

###### Is the **supervision** library correctly integrated to handle object tracking, maintain unique IDs, and count objects within the video stream?

##### Multi-Stream Object Tracking and Counting

###### Is the system capable of managing and processing multiple video streams at the same time, displaying real-time tracking and counting results for each?

###### Does the implementation ensure unique IDs for tracked individuals and handles state management across video streams to prevent ID mismatches?

###### Does the project include logic for tracking and counting entries and exits within specified regions of interest (ROIs)?

###### Check that trained weights are saved in: `models/checkpoints/best.pt`

##### Streamlit App Development

###### Is the **Streamlit** app implemented to display video feeds with overlaid detection, tracking, and counting information?

###### Does the app include interactive elements for switching between streams, adjusting detection thresholds, and customizing tracking parameters?

###### Is video rendering optimized using **OpenCV** and **Streamlit**, providing real-time overlays and maintaining performance?

##### Performance Optimization

###### Does the project use **CUDA** and GPU acceleration for processing, ensuring efficient handling of real-time video inputs?

###### Are techniques like **model pruning** and **quantization** implemented to enhance inference speed and minimize latency?

###### Is the Streamlit app tested with various video resolutions to ensure efficient processing without significant performance drops?

##### Visualization and Analysis

###### Does the Streamlit app provide clear visual overlays on video streams, showing tracking IDs and counting results in real time?

###### Does the app include performance metrics, such as FPS and processing time, for user insight into real-time processing efficiency?

###### Are evaluation metrics presented, showcasing precision, recall, and F1-score to assess the effectiveness of detection and tracking?

###### Check:

- Require metrics file:

  ```
  reports/performance_metrics.json
  ```

- Validate JSON includes:

  ```json
  {
  "detection_precision": ...,
  "detection_recall": ...,
  "f1_score": ...,
  "average_fps_per_stream": ...,
  "average_latency_ms": ...
  }
  ```

- Add minimum thresholds:

  Precision ≥ 0.85

  Recall ≥ 0.80

  F1 ≥ 0.85

  FPS ≥ 15 (720p)

- Add check that metrics are visible in Streamlit dashboard (FPS + latency shown live).

##### Additional Considerations

###### Does the codebase is documented with comments and explanations for readability and maintainability?

###### Does the project include additional features such as custom counting logic or integrations with other libraries for improved tracking accuracy?

###### Is comprehensive error handling implemented to manage potential issues in data loading, video processing, and library integrations, ensuring the app remains stable?
