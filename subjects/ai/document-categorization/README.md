## Document Categorization

### Overview

This project is designed to create an **intelligent document categorization and tagging system** that leverages AI to enhance document management workflows. By applying **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **machine learning** techniques, this system can automatically classify documents into predefined categories and generate contextually relevant tags. Key features include **real-time categorization**, **multi-language support**, and **context-aware tagging**. Built using **TensorFlow** and **NLP libraries like SpaCy**, the system incorporates **transfer learning** to adapt to domain-specific contexts and optimizations for processing large volumes of documents efficiently.

### Role play

You are taking on the role of a Data Scientist tasked with building and implementing an intelligent document categorization and tagging system. Your challenge is to ensure the system meets the requirements for accuracy, scalability, and multi-language support, while maintaining high real-time performance.

### Learning Objectives

The project aims to develop skills in:

- Applying **NLP and machine learning** techniques for document classification and tagging.
- Utilizing **TensorFlow** and **SpaCy** for efficient NLP model development.
- Implementing **transfer learning** to improve model adaptability to specific document domains.
- Designing scalable solutions for **real-time processing** and **high-volume data management**.

### Instructions

#### Data Loading and Preprocessing

1. **Dataset Preparation**:
   - Load a dataset containing various document types across multiple categories and languages.
   - Preprocess the data, including text normalization, tokenization, and handling multi-language support.

2. **Annotation and Labeling**:
   - Use labeled data for model training, with categories and tags specific to the content and structure of each document.
   - Ensure annotations are organized for supervised learning tasks, with well-defined categories and tags for each document.

#### Model Development

1. **Text Classification Model**:
   - Implement a **text classification model** using **TensorFlow** or **Keras**, starting with a baseline architecture.
   - Use **transfer learning** to enhance the model’s domain adaptability, incorporating pre-trained language models such as **BERT** or **DistilBERT**.

2. **Tagging with NLP Libraries**:
   - Leverage **SpaCy** to develop an intelligent tagging system that can assign tags based on the document's content and context.
   - Ensure the tagging system supports multi-language functionality, utilizing language models for effective tagging in different languages.

3. **Context-Aware Tagging Logic**:
   - Integrate a tagging mechanism that recognizes the context within the document and assigns tags relevant to its content.
   - Implement **Named Entity Recognition (NER)** to improve tagging accuracy, extracting key entities such as names, dates, and organizations for more precise tags.

#### Real-Time Document Categorization and Tagging

1. **Real-Time Processing Pipeline**:
   - Develop a pipeline to handle real-time document classification and tagging, ensuring minimal latency.
   - Set up batching or streaming mechanisms to manage high-volume document input and optimize throughput.

2. **Multi-Language Support**:
   - Incorporate language detection and automatic switching between language models.
   - Ensure accurate tagging and classification for documents in various languages, adapting the pipeline to handle language-specific nuances.

#### Transfer Learning and Model Optimization

1. **Transfer Learning for Domain-Specific Contexts**:
   - Fine-tune the pre-trained language models to specialize in specific document types or industry contexts.
   - Implement training routines to adapt the model to new domains without extensive retraining on each dataset.

2. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Use techniques such as **model pruning** and **quantization** to enhance performance and reduce processing times.
   - Benchmark and optimize for high-volume data environments, ensuring the system can handle significant loads with low latency.

#### Visualization and Monitoring

1. **Real-Time Dashboard**:
   - Develop a **Streamlit** or **Flask** app to display real-time categorization and tagging results.
   - Include visualizations of category distributions, tag counts, and language breakdowns.

2. **Performance Metrics**:
   - Track key metrics, such as processing speed, accuracy, and model confidence, in the dashboard.
   - Display language-specific accuracy and error analysis for insights into model performance across different languages.

### Tips

1. **Data Quality & Preprocessing**
   - Pay attention to encoding, text cleaning, and normalization, especially with multi-language data.
   - Always remove unwanted characters, duplicated text, or formatting artifacts before training.

2. **Multi-Language Handling**
   - Use automatic language detection to route documents to the right SpaCy or Hugging Face model.
   - Keep tokenization language-specific to avoid poor segmentation.

3. **Model Training**
   - Start with a small pre-trained model (e.g., DistilBERT) before moving to larger models like BERT.
   - Regularly save checkpoints during fine-tuning to avoid losing progress.

4. **Context-Aware Tagging**
   - Use **Named Entity Recognition (NER)** results to enrich tag generation.
   - Combine rule-based and machine learning approaches for higher tagging precision.

5. **Real-Time Performance**
   - Batch incoming documents to improve processing speed.
   - Consider using asynchronous calls if you implement real-time tagging with Flask or Streamlit.

6. **Evaluation**
   - Evaluate your model using precision, recall, and F1-score.
   - Test the tagging accuracy separately from classification accuracy.

7. **Visualization**
   - Display model performance metrics in the dashboard (accuracy, latency, language stats).
   - Visualize the frequency of categories and tags over time.

8. **Code Quality**
   - Keep your scripts modular and well-documented.
   - Use functions for data loading, preprocessing, and inference to simplify debugging and reusability.

9. **Scalability**
   - Plan for deployment — ensure the pipeline can handle large volumes of documents.
   - Optimize models with pruning or quantization to reduce latency.

10. **Interpretability**

- Log top keywords or entities that influence categorization decisions.
- Make your dashboard explain how and why each document was categorized.
