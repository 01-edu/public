#### Document Categorization and Tagging System

##### Preliminary

###### Does the project structure matches the setup outlined in the README, with organized folders and files for data, models, utilities, and documentation?

###### Is there a README.md file that explains how to run the code and the global approach?

###### Is there a `requirements.txt` or `environment.yml` file listing all necessary libraries and their versions?

##### Data Processing and Exploratory Data Analysis

###### Has the dataset been preprocessed to handle multi-language content and ensure compatibility with the model?

##### Model Development

###### Is the text classification model implemented with TensorFlow, and does it incorporate transfer learning?

###### Has the tagging system been developed with SpaCy and integrated for context-aware tagging?

##### Real-Time Document Categorization and Tagging

###### Is the real-time processing pipeline efficient and capable of handling high document volumes?

###### Does the system support multi-language detection and handle language-specific tagging accurately?

##### Transfer Learning and Model Optimization

###### Has transfer learning been applied to adapt the model to domain-specific contexts?

###### Have model optimization techniques been implemented to improve performance?

##### Visualization and Monitoring

###### Does the real-time dashboard display categorization and tagging results?

###### Are performance metrics, such as processing speed and accuracy, displayed in the dashboard?

##### Additional Considerations

###### Is the code well-documented, with comments explaining each function?

###### Are there additional features, such as non-linear tagging logic or advanced tagging mechanisms?

###### Has error handling been implemented for stability, especially with multi-language data and high-volume processing?
