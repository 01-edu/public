## SP500 strategies

### Overview

In this project, you'll apply machine learning to finance. Your goal as a Quant/Data Scientist is to create a financial strategy that uses a signal generated by a machine learning model to outperform the [SP500](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S%26P_500).

The S&P 500 Index is a collection of 500 stocks that represent the overall performance of the U.S. stock market. The stocks in the S&P 500 are chosen based on factors like market value, liquidity, and industry. These selections are made by the S&P 500 Index Committee, which is a group of analysts from Standard & Poor's.

The S&P 500 started in 1926 with only 90 stocks and has grown to include 500 stocks since 1957. Historically, the average annual return of the S&P 500 has been about 10-11% since 1926, and around 8% since 1957.

### Role play

As a Quantitative Researcher, your challenge is to develop a strategy that can consistently outperform the S&P 500, not just in one year, but over many years. This is a difficult task and is the primary goal of many hedge funds around the world.

### Learning Objective

- **Data processing and feature engineering**: Build a dataset: insightful features and the target
- **Machine Learning pipeline**: Train machine learning models on the dataset, select the best model and generate the machine learning signal.
- **Strategy backtesting**: Generate a strategy from the Machine Learning model output and backtest the strategy. As a reminder, the idea here is to see what would have performed the strategy if you had invested.

### Instructions

#### Data processing and features engineering

The file `HistoricalData.csv` contains the open-high-low-close (OHLC) SP500 index data and the other file, `all_stocks_5yr.csv`, contains the open-high-low-close-volume (OHLCV) data on the SP500 constituents.

- Split the data in train and test. The test set should set from **2017**.
- Your first priority is to build a dataset without leakage.

Note: Financial data can be complex and tricky to analyse for a lot of reasons. In order to focus on Time Series forecasting, the project gives access to a "simplified" financial dataset. For instance, we consider the composition of the SP500 remains similar over time which is not true and which introduces a "survivor bias". Plus, the data during COVID-19 was removed because it may have a significant impact on the backtesting.

**"No leakage" [intro](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leakage_(machine_learning)>).**
We assume it is day `D`, and we want to take a position on the next n days. The position starts on day D+1 (included). To decide whether we take a short or long position the return between day D+1 and D+2 is computed and used as a target. Finally, as features on day contain information until day D 11:59pm, target need to be shifted. As a result, the final DataFrame schema is:

| Index   |          Features          |           Target |
| ------- | :------------------------: | ---------------: |
| Day D-1 | Features until D-1 23:59pm |   return(D, D+1) |
| Day D   |  Features until D 23:59pm  | return(D+1, D+2) |
| Day D+1 | Features until D+1 23:59pm | return(D+2, D+3) |

**Note: This table is simplified, the index of your DataFrame is a multi-index with date and ticker.**

- Features: - Bollinger - RSI - MACD
  **Note: you can use any library to compute these features, you don't need to implement all financial features from scratch.**

- Target:
  - On day D, the target is: **sign(return(D+1, D+2))**

> Remark: The target used is the return computed on the price and not the price directly. There are statistical reasons for this choice - the price is not stationary. The consequence is that a machine learning model tends to overfit while training on not stationary data.

#### Machine learning pipeline

- Cross-validation deliverables:
  - Implements a cross validation with at least 10 folds. The train set has to be bigger than 2 years history.
  - Two types of temporal cross-validations are required:
    - Blocking (plot below)
    - Time Series split (plot below)
  - Make sure the last fold of the train set does not overlap on the test set.
  - Make sure the folds do not contain data from the same day. The data should be split on the dates.
  - Plot your cross validation as follows:

![alt text][blocking]

[blocking]: blocking_time_series_split.png "Blocking Time Series split"

![alt text][timeseries]

[timeseries]: Time_series_split.png "Time Series split"

Once you'll have run the grid search on the cross validation (choose either Blocking or Time Series split), you'll select the best pipeline on the train set and save it as `selected_model.pkl` and `selected_model.txt` (pipeline hyperparameters).

**Note: You may observe that the selected model is not good after analyzing the ML metrics (ON THE TRAIN SET) and select another one. **

- ML metrics and feature importance on the selected pipeline on the train set only.
  - DataFrame with a Machine learning metrics to train and validation sets on all folds of the train set. Suggested format: columns: ML metrics (AUC, Accuracy, `LogLoss`), rows: folds, train set and validation set (double index). Save it as `ml_metrics_train.csv`
  - Plot. Choose the metric you want. Suggested: AUC Save it as `metric_train.png`. The plot below shows how the plot should look like.
  - DataFrame with top 10 important features for each fold. Save it as `top_10_feature_importance.csv`

![alt text][barplot]

[barplot]: metric_plot.png "Metric plot"

- The signal has to be generated with the chosen cross validation: train the model on the train set of the first fold, then predict on its validation set; train the model on the train set of the second fold, then predict on its validation set, etc ... Then, concatenate the predictions on the validation sets to build the machine learning signal. **The pipeline shouldn't be trained once and predict on all data points!**

**The output is a DataFrame or Series with a double index ordered with the probability the stock price for asset `i` increases between d+1 and d+2.**

- (optional): [Train an RNN/LSTM](https://towardsdatascience.com/predicting-stock-price-with-lstm-13af86a74944). This is a nice way to discover and learn about recurrent neural networks. But keep in mind that there are some new neural network architectures that seem to outperform recurrent neural networks. Here is an [interesting article](https://towardsdatascience.com/the-fall-of-rnn-lstm-2d1594c74ce0) about the topic.

#### Strategy backtesting

- Backtesting module deliverables. The module takes as input a machine learning signal, convert it into a financial strategy. A financial strategy DataFrame gives the amount invested at time `t` on asset `i`. The module returns the following metrics on the train set and the test set.
  - Profit and Loss (PnL) plot: save it as `strategy.png`
    - x axis: date
    - y axis1: PnL of the strategy at time `t`
    - y axis2: PnL of the SP500 at time `t`
    - Use the same scale for y axis1 and y axis2
    - add a line that shows the separation between train set and test set
  - Pnl
  - [Max drawdown](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/drawdown.asp)
  - (Optional): add other metrics as Sharpe ratio, volatility, etc ...
  - Create a markdown report that explains and save it as `report.md`:
    - the features used
    - the pipeline used
      - `Imputer`
      - `Scaler`
      - dimension reduction
      - model
    - the cross-validation used
      - length of train sets and validation sets
      - cross-validation plot (optional)
    - strategy chosen
      - description
      - PnL plot
      - strategy metrics on the train set and test set

#### Example of strategies:

- Long only:
  - Binary signal:
    0: do nothing for one day on asset `i`
    1: take a long position on asset `i` for 1 day
  - Weights proportional to the machine learning signals
    - invest x on asset `i` for on day
- Long and short: For those who search long short strategy on Google, don't get wrong, this has nothing to do with pair trading.

  - Binary signal:
    - -1: take a short position on asset `i` for 1 day
    - 1: take a long position on asset `i` for 1 day
  - Ternary signal:
    - -1: take a short position on asset `i` for 1 day
    - 0: do nothing for one day on asset `i`
    - 1: take a long position on asset `i` for 1 day

  Notes:

  - Warning! When you don't invest on all stock as in the binary signal or the ternary signal, make sure that you are still investing $1 per day!

  - In order to simplify the **short position** we consider that this is the opposite of a long position. Example: I take a short one AAPL stock and the price decreases by $20 on one day. I earn $20.

- Stock picking: Take a long position on the `k` best assets (from the machine learning signal) and short the `k` worst assets regarding the machine learning signal.

Here's an example on how to convert a machine learning signal into a financial strategy:

- Input:

| Date    | Ticker | Machine Learning signal |
| ------- | :----: | ----------------------: |
| Day D-1 |  AAPL  |                    0.55 |
| Day D-1 |   C    |                    0.36 |
| Day D   |  AAPL  |                    0.59 |
| Day D   |   C    |                    0.33 |
| Day D+1 |  AAPL  |                    0.61 |
| Day D+1 |   C    |                    0.33 |

- Convert it into a binary long only strategy:
  - Machine learning signal > 0.5

| Date    | Ticker | Binary signal |
| ------- | :----: | ------------: |
| Day D-1 |  AAPL  |             1 |
| Day D-1 |   C    |             0 |
| Day D   |  AAPL  |             1 |
| Day D   |   C    |             0 |
| Day D+1 |  AAPL  |             1 |
| Day D+1 |   C    |             0 |

!!! BE CAREFUL !!!THIS IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT.

- Multiply it with the associated return.

  Don't forget the meaning of the signal on day d: it gives the return between d+1 and d+2. You should multiply the binary signal of day by the return computed between d+1 and d+2. Otherwise, it's wrong because you use your signal that gives you information on d+1 and d+2 on the past or present. The strategy is leaked!

**Assumption**: you have $1 per day to invest in your strategy.
