## Nested Objects

Since objects are values, nothing stops you from having objects inside objects.

This is very common and allows to model more complex things.

### Instructions

Create an object `address` with 3 properties:

- `city` property with a value of type `String`
- `postcode` property with a value of type `Number`
- `street` property with a value of type `Object` and 2 properties:
  - `name` property with a value of type `String`
  - `number` property with a value of type `Number`
