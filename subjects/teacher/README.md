### Instructions

"I need this report!"

"A **true teacher** does not jealously guard his mastery."

The commissioner was most impressed by the result of your answers.
He has now asked your help to create a training program that will be based on your report for the future police inspectors.

In a training folder, various folders `mystery` were prepared with some key differences in the data for each group of trainees.

To simplify your life as a teacher and as the answers will not be exactly the same in each `mystery` folder, you need to write a `teacher.sh` file that does the following:

- step 1, it isolates, into an environment variable and through a similar command that you used to find it, the number (**and only the number**) of the key interview that helped solved the mystery (Unlike the interview number, the path will not change across the `mystery` folders that will be tested, hence the command to find the interview is the same across all the `mystery` folders that will be tested).
- step 2, it prints the newly created environment variable.
- step 3, it prints what the interview contains.
- step 4, it prints the content of the environment variable MAIN_SUSPECT.

Now show them who is the boss...
