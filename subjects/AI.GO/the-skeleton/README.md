## The skeleton

> Brainpower mode

### Context

To craft your robot friend, you first need to build its skeleton, and that's where HTML comes in. HTML is the blueprint that sets up the structure of your robot, giving it shape and form. With HTML, you'll create the framework that holds all your amazing ideas together. Ready to start building? Letâ€™s dive in and create the foundation of your robot buddy!

> For the whole quest, the principle is to iterate over your code: when you finish an exercise, copy-paste your code to use it in the next one.

> Contrary to what you will see in the videos, you don't have to run a server on your machine to use the HTML, CSS and JavaScript thanks to the integrated code editor that takes care of all that.  
> We've left the videos for the other educational content they provide.

### Files naming

- for the HTML files: `name-of-the-exercise.html`
- for the CSS files: when you have to link one, it's named like so: `name-of-the-exercise.css`

### Instructions

Ready? Let's code!

> The first step to achieve in your quest is to craft the shape of your robot ; for that, 2 things needs to be done:
>
> - Customize the( [`<head>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/head) tag)
> - Customize the ([`<title>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/title) tag)

To create any project, some things need to be declared in the HTML file - those are not visible elements in your page, but things cannot work without them.

#### The `<head>` part:

Choose a power that you will give to your robot from the following list and put it as a `<title>`:

- invisibility
- light-speed
- super-strength
- advanced-healing
- mind-link

#### The `<body>` part:

This section contains the content of your webpage , in our case the lower body of your buddy. Define the skeleton of your robot by organizing it into three main sections: the face, the upper body, and the lower body. Inside the `<body>` tag of your HTML file, create three divisions using `<section>` tags, and place the following text content inside each one: face, upper-body, lower-body.

> Don't forget to press Render again to refresh the display page when you modify your code.

### Code examples

To create a `div` tag with `hello` as text content inside the `body`:

```html
<body>
  <div>hello</div>
</body>
```
