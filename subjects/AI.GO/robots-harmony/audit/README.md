###### Check if the `robots-harmony.html` file includes a `<div>` with the ID gallery.

###### Verify that each robot is placed inside its own div with a class of `name-robot` (The name is the team member's name).

###### Ensure that each robot's section has an `<h3>` for the robot’s name and a `<p>` for the robot’s description.

###### Is the HTML structure properly set up according to the instructions?

###### Does each robot have its unique div with appropriate classes and tags?
