## Call it

### Context

Congrats! You created the very first base for your entity and you witnessed its appearance in the Digital
World - your browser.. However, it is still a tiny seed of the marvelous thing it could become. Be patient;
there's still a bit of work to do.

### Directions

First of all, instead of writing down what things are _(you're not writing down on your hand the word 'hand',
are you?)_, we're going to identify them semantically with the very practical [id
attribute](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/id). This `id` has to be a **unique**
identifier on your webpage, allowing you to target your element when needed. You can compare it to your name and
surname; this is what identifies you to other people, and if someone's calling you by your name, you answer.

### Instructions

So let's identify the 3 elements we have so far: in each section, remove the text content from inside the tag
and set it as the value of the `id` attribute of the corresponding `section` text.

**Run your code in the editor preview:** \
you don't see _anything_? Don't freak out! \
Inspect the HTML that has been created with your
[browser inspector tool](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/What_are_browser_developer_tools),
and if you done it correctly, you should see the 3 sections inside the `body` with the `id` attribute set in
your HTML structure.

### Code examples

To set the `id` of a `div` tag to `"my-lil-div"`:

```html
<div id="my-lil-div"></div>
```
