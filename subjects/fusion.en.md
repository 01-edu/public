## fusion

### Instructions

The objective of this exercise is to merge objects into a new object depending on the values type

With this create a function called `fusion` that:
- If the type is an array you must concat it
- If it is a string you must concatenate with a space
- If it is numbers you must added them
- If it is an object you must fusion them recursively
- In case of other types you must replace it with the value of the second object
- In case the value don't match you must replace it with the value of the second object
