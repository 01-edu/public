## 🌟 Parenting 👨‍👧

You are now beginning **BONUS** exercises, those are made to make you explore JS
a bit more by yourself and show you more obscure / weird aspects of the
language.

**Only spend time on those if you are ahead !**

If you feel already a bit overwhelmed by all you had to learn so far, don't feel
bad to skip them.

### Circular Structure

We call a circular Structure when an object has a property which value is
itself.

### Instructions

You will make such circular structure by representing a `parent` / `child`
relationship.

Declare 2 variables of objects:

- The object `parent` with a `child` property of the `child` object
- The object `child` with a `parent` property of the `parent` object
