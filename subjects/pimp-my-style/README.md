## Pimp my style

### Instructions

Check out that button on the HTML page:

```html
<button class="button">pimp my style</div>
```

For now, it's only a lonely, basic and sad element. let's pimp it up.

On each click on the page, a function `pimp` is triggered.
Write the body of that function so that the button's class is altered:

- From the data file provided, add each of the `styles` array elements as classes, in order.
- When the end of the array is reached, remove the classes in a LIFO fashion.
- While removing classes, toggle the `unpimp` class on. And toggle it off again while adding classes.


Example for a `styles` array with only 3 classes:
```js
["one", "two", "three"]
```

```
Page load --> <button class="button"></button>

...adding
Click 1 --> <button class="button one"></button>
Click 2 --> <button class="button one two"></button>

...toggling `unpimp`
Click 3 --> <button class="button one two three unpimp"></button>

...and removing backwards
Click 4 --> <button class="button one two unpimp"></button>
Click 5 --> <button class="button one unpimp"></button>
Click 6 --> <button class="button"></button>
```
