## Olympic

### Instructions

The Olympic games just ended and you want to tell everyone about the ranking of
your favorite athlete: Pedro.

Look for the position of Pedro inside the array `athletes`.
For the first to the third position, log the matching medal emoji ðŸ¥‡ðŸ¥ˆðŸ¥‰.
Otherwise log this disapointed emoji: ðŸ˜ž and a message of his exact ranking.

Example, if pedro is in 10th place, the message to log would be:

```js
'ðŸ˜ž Pedro is #10'

```
