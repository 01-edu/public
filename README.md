### 🍎 Our Courses

All of our courses are meticulously crafted to offer challenging yet enjoyable, high-quality subjects and projects.

### 🎭 **Our Philosophy**

Some of our subjects are **intentionally designed** to be **ambiguous** or **less specific**, reflecting our unique pedagogical approach. Please keep this in mind before reporting any [**⁉️ issues**](https://github.com/01-edu/public/issues) or support requests.

### 🫶 **Contribute**

We welcome contributions! Feel free to submit a [**🪢 pull request**](https://github.com/01-edu/public/pulls). Due to the high volume of tasks, there may be a delay in reviewing your submission.

Thank you!<br>
